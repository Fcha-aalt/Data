## Abstract
"This study provides an insight into the design philosophy and the practical techniques employed to design a smart energy efficient building, which reduces the negative impact on the environment and its resources. Green building is one of the forefront measures that can mitigate significant impacts of the building stock on the environment, society and economy. The building's energy efficiency is improved through the use of Passive and Active Techniques. Passive energy efficiency is achieved through reducing the internal heat loss or internal heat gain of a building. This can also be realized through the use of equipment which does not require high amounts of energy to function such as light tunnels. Passive energy efficiency can be achieved through improvements to the building thermal envelope and building materials such as insulation and shading of windows to reduce the energy demand for heating, cooling and artificial lighting."
