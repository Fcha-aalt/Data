## Abstract
"People spend most of their time indoors, and thus it is important to provide occupants with a comfortable indoor thermal environment. However, inappropriate thermostat temperature settings in offices make occupants less comfortable. This study developed a new control strategy for HVAC systems that adjusts the thermostat setpoint according to clothing level and mean facial skin temperature. An image-classification model was trained on the basis of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the clothing level of occupants, which was then used to calculate a comfortable air temperature. This investigation used a long-wave infrared (LWIR) camera with a face-detection program to obtain occupantsâ€™ mean facial skin temperature. This study performed experimental tests to correlate mean facial skin temperature with thermal sensation votes. The mean facial skin temperature was then used to develop a control strategy for an HVAC system in a single-occupant office. With the use of the control strategy, 91% of the subjects tested in this investigation felt thermally neutral in the office."
