## Abstract
"Buildings are one of the major responsible of energy consumption and carbon emissions worldwide. Due to the continuous growth of cities, researchers moved their focus from single buildings to urban scale analyses. The present work aims at demonstrating the reliability of a lumped-capacitance model in the evaluation of heating and cooling demand at urban level. The model presented extends a previous one with different modules for solar radiation pre-processing, HVAC systems and photovoltaic production estimation. A case-study district of 13 buildings in Padua (Italy) has been analysed, considering detailed single buildings simulations with EnergyPlus as benchmark. Results show that the model leads to good accuracy in the evaluation of the district energy demand for both space heating and cooling. The major sources of error are geometrical simplifications, shadowing and thermal zoning effects, thus showing the importance of high-quality input data in urban modelling. However, results highlight how simple corrections may enhance the accuracy when detailed geometrical information is not available. Finally, the model has been used to assess the cost and energy saving potential of several building retrofit measures and PV installations on the considered district, providing an important indication in the investment priority for decision makers."
