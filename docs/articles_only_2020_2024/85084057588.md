## Abstract
"The optimization of building materials and energy technologies is imperative to reduce building energy consumption and thereby minimize greenhouse gas emissions. Common energy retrofits include the addition of walls or roof insulation, window renovations, heating upgrades, installation of ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and managing the building's operational schedules. Historic buildings differ from other general buildings in two major aspects that affect energy retrofits. This study analyzed the effect of) Energy Efficiency Measure (EEMs) packages, which improve the hygrothermal and energy performances using infrared thermography images and building simulation. The hygrothermal and energy performances were analyzed separately for the office and museum. EEM1 is a package that adds 150 mm PUR insulation only to roof and wall. EEM1 significantly reduced the risk of mold growth after three years, as mold index values approached zero. The results of EEM1 show that additional application of insulation could reduce the risk of mold growth. Results of the energy retrofit analysis indicate that improvements in the window performance and airtightness reduce the heating energy consumption. In particular, the improvement in airtightness drastically reduced heating energy consumption in winter. Whereas all EEMs packages applied to buildings reduced heating energy consumption, EEM5 achieved a heating energy reduction of 72% and a total energy consumption reduction of 60%. EEM5 is a package that integrates all the technologies for maximum energy savings including adding insulation, improving airtightness, replacing window systems, installing internal blinds, and replacing LED lighting. Building performance retrofits will be the subject of further studies, enabling the continued use and conservation of historic buildings."
