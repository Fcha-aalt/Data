## Abstract
"Optimum air distribution system should provide the basic requirements of healthy environment in the Operating Theatre, which depends in turn mainly on the air supply, extract outlet positions, and the operating table orientation. The complexity of the Surgical Operating Theatre requirements is shown in the present computational cases and the associated sophistication of the air treatment, to attain the guideline recommended by the National Health Service Estates of UK, was adequately represented. The present program accounts for the thermal loads of the room, humans, equipment and supply air. Turbulence characteristics as identified here by the shear stresses indicate that higher turbulence level appears in the roof zone. Energy Efficiency improvement in Air-Conditioned Operating Theatres was found to depend, mainly on the theatre airside design configurations and operating parameters. The room airside design is one of the essential factors that strongly influence the HVAC airflow pattern and consequently the air quality and comfort inside the surgical operating theatres. The present work introduces some recommendations for airside designs to facilitate the development of optimum HVAC systems."
