## Abstract
"The paper considers the problem of optimal energy consumption control in a multi-zone office building. To solve this problem, a hierarchical digital model of building energy consumption has been created. This digital model comprises six digital models. Five low-level digital models are designed to simulate the energy consumption for individual building zones. The top-level digital model is used to calculate the building's total energy consumption. To implement all digital models, artificial neural networks have been used. The input data to train neural networks were obtained using the EnergyPlus energy modeling system. A genetic algorithm was used to determine the optimal solution to the problem. The results of solving the problem are provided for specific input data on the building structure and materials, HVAC equipment parameters, and weather conditions of a certain region of Russia."
