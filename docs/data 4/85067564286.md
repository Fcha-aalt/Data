## Abstract
"Design faults in HVAC installations have a significant impact on building efficiency, energy consumption, and user comfort. The objective of this research is to analyze the recurrence of complaints related to design faults in HVAC installations of housing buildings. Expert reports related to 168 complaints made by users regarding HVAC installations were analyzed, with the results showing that attached houses have more problems with heating installations and that the problems in apartment blocks are mostly related to ventilation. The most recurring complaints were related to dysfunctions and anomalies (63.10%), followed by runoffs and condensation (18.45%). The installations with the most faults were ventilation (45.83%), followed by heating (35.12%) and air conditioning (19.05%). A series of thermohygrometric variables that increase the probability of design faults in HVAC installations were also studied: wind speed, precipitation, average temperature and relative humidity."
