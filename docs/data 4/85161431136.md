## Abstract
"Approximately 90 million of Nigeria's residents are without electricity access; this represents 12.5% of the world's population without access. Nigeria is challenged in meeting goal 7 of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) due to inadequate power generation to meet demands, poor transmission networks and insufficient investment. Proposing energy audits and efficiency measures, such as proper housekeeping, retrofitting electrical systems and installing renewable energy sources, will help reduce energy consumption and mitigate the country's energy crisis. This study conducted on a residential building in Nigeria found that retrofitting the building lighting system could achieve annual savings of as much as 230kWh and have a payback period of 9 months with a return on investment (ROI) of 126%. The retrofit of the pump system is expected to save 182kWh within a payback period of 2 years and have an ROI of 50%. The installation of solar panels and retrofit of batteries is expected to save 3MWh at a capital cost of N300,000, with an ROI of 26% and a net present value of over N690,000. These measures would also reduce a total of 1.97 tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually."
