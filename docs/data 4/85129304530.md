## Abstract
"Buildings account for 40% of total primary energy consumption and 30% of all CO2 emissions worldwide. A large portion of building energy consumption is due to heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. In the summer, for example, more than 50% of a building's electricity consumption is used for cooling. With proper energy management, buildings can provide load shifting, peak shaving, frequency regulation, and many other demand response services."
