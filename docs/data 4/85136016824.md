## Abstract
"This paper provides a pioneering, top-down analysis of the non-residential building stock in Brazil. A country-wide dataset was used, comprising 10,000 buildings divided into 12 typologies. Key indicators include floor area, energy use intensity, and operation patterns. In addition, predominant wall constructions, lighting systems, equipment, water heating, and HVAC systems for each typology were identified, including average density power for the systems. Data from the Brazilian Energy Balance report was correlated with the sample of buildings to determine the proportion of each building typology in the total energy consumption of the country, considering different energy sources. This study provides an innovative and up-to-date status of the characteristics of non-residential buildings in Brazil. A complementary statistical analysis addressed the correlation between energy use intensity and the building characteristics including an ANOVA test and a regression analysis in order to investigate the influence of the energy usage indicators (Lighting Power Density, Equipment Power Density, Cooling capacity) on the energy use intensity of each building typology in Brazil. This study is intended to serve as a reference for building characteristics and building energy performance in Brazil, and hence support diverse research regarding country-level building stock modeling, energy benchmarking, climate change impacts, and energy-efficiency related studies."
