## Abstract
"This article shows a real ongoing project called RenoActive, which is financed by company Velux. In cooperation with the company mentioned above an old single-family house was chosen to renovate. Three energy alternatives had been calculated: Standard, Comfort and Deluxe. The thermal insulation system of the building is almost the same in all three alternatives. The alternatives mostly appear in the building services systems. This article evaluates the energy consumption and investment differences between the alternatives."
