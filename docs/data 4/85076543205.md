## Abstract
"The research presents an energy strategy during the design process using advanced energy performance simulation technology. Team coordination and building performance efficiency during the design process is aided by conducting a performance based assessment with comprehensive fully incorporated design, construction, energy, HVAC and annual building operation. Performance based decision making is demonstrated through an office building complex. The engineering decisions were based on performance enhancement and overall energy demand reduction, which was evaluated on an annual basis. The building envelope's dominant curtain wall system was analyzed in detail in order to demonstrate qualitative energy performance improvement. ASHRAE 90.1 App. G System 7 VAV with reheat HVAC's annual energy performance was estimated and evaluated from the aspect of end-use energy which is usually the baseline system for achieving LEED energy performance credits."
