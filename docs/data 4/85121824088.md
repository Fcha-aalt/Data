## Abstract
"This review synthesizes the possible lower GWP substitutes for the R-410A refrigerant, since high GWP HFCs refrigerants are being controlled due to the growing worldwide concern over climate change in the HVAC&R area. Therefore, pure refrigerants (HFCs, HCs, and HFOs) and different types of blends with lower GWP than R-410A were evaluated to find the possible alternative that can operate without any modifications in equipment that was initially designed for R-410A, in other words, potential drop-in candidates. For the analysis, the most important performance parameters were compared based on experimental data reported in the literature, including cooling (or heating) capacity, energy efficiency, and compressor discharge temperature. Furthermore, an assessment of the environmental impact of these candidates using the TEWI and LCCP methodologies was performed. Importantly, this study identified two HFO/HFC mixtures (DR-55 and DR-5A) as potential candidates, both with high availability in the market. These mixtures presented COP, cooling/heating capacity, and discharge temperature similar to those observed in equipment operating with the baseline refrigerant. Finally, these candidates also revealed the lowest TEWI and LCCP values, thus indicating a significant reduction in environmental impact. Considering the performance parameters and the climate change impact parameters, these mixtures are the most suitable candidates for residential air conditioners and heat pumps."
