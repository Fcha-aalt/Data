## Abstract
"In this paper, the online evaluation system for a chiller plant is proposed, which is significant for improving the energy efficiency and operation security of the chiller plant. For a general evaluation result, the system can estimate the chiller plant from three aspects: operating security, system performance, and cooling-supply quality, respectively. For each aspect, the paper presents a dynamic scoring method, which can convert the abstract evaluation indexes into the visualized contents by different evaluation demands. At the end of this paper, the effectiveness of the system is verified to perform excellently in practicability and operability, and it can also be used in most of the chiller plants."
