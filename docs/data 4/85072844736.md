## Abstract
"There are a lot of international or national environmental classification systems for building projects. The Building Information Foundation RTS noticed a need for national classification system in Finland, where the target was to improve indoor air quality, moisture management, carbon footprint, energy efficiency, material choices and worksite technology and of course to save money in construction processes and maintenance of the premises. A Finnish Environmental Classification system called Green Leadership Tool for construction processes has been developed for managing the actual building process, environmental, economic and sociocultural aspects as described in the CEN/TC 350-standards. The criteria were made with construction industry and published by The Building Information Foundation RTS in the year 2017. The major part of the criteria utilizes existing classifications and certifications developed in Finland as EPD's, Building Performance Indicators of GBC Finland, the emission classification of building materials and cleanliness classification of HVAC devices (M1-label), Classification of Indoor Environment (CIE2018), Energy Audit (E-Value), Green Factor Tool, Drychain10 and other relevant information provided into market. The tool and criteria are suitable for all property owner's despite of the background and business model. There are four construction project types included: new building, renovation and partial renovation, enlargement/change of the space and two main buildings types: office/service and residential buildings. The Finnish legislation has been updated on the year 2017, the new LEVEL's certification criteria have been developed and the new Classification of Indoor Environment 2018 has been updated and consequently there was a demand to update the RTS criteria as well. The classification was launched in the spring 2017 and there are 83 active projects and 140 users in the tool on April 2019. The environmental classification of building processes follows the changes, developments and needs of the market, therefore the criteria will be updated continuously. The new criteria have been used in several projects and experiments of the criteria and projects will be presented."
