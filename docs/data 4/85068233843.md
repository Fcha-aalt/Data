## Abstract
"Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a process that collects building data in a central data model. This data can not only be used to plan and construct a building but to design the controls for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. The relevant information about the building and its systems is used as the base for controller design, opening new opportunities like the automated testing and optimization of control strategies, both for energy efficiency and user comfort. This paper shows how the information in the BIM is used to design control strategies, including a completeness check and a resulting data set enhancement of this necessary information. It also shows a way, how a building, which is already operating, can be optimized using the operation data from energy systems to modify the existing controllers. The methodology is executed using a ventilation system that provides air quality by means of CO2-driven control."
