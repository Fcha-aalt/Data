## Abstract
"The aim of HVAC-systems in buildings is to provide a healthy and comfortable comfortable indoor environment,indoor environment, indoor environment,indoor environment, which enhances the performance of occupants. The goal is to guarantee this to guarantee this to guarantee this optimal indoor environment at the low energy consumption. Heating, cooling, ventilation and lighting appliances account for more than one third of the world primary energy demand. There is an obvious need for an increase in the efficiency if energy use in buildings. The great potential for possible savings not only in the amount of energy. but also in the used energy quality exists. by making possible the wider use of renewable or free energy sources in an efficient way, and the development if innovative system Solutions for built environment The lecture presents the basic principles of low exergy systems, but with the focus on practical applications, e.g. design and installation of such systems."
