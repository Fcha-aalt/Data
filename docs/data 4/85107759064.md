## Abstract
"The consumption of energy in enormous amounts is one of the prime areas of concern for the researchers globally. The focus is on buildings as they are the biggest consumers of energy. The analysis of energy consumption pattern of buildings diverts our attention toward the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system which according to studies accounts for maximum energy consumption within buildings. This research employs several regression techniques to predict the energy consumption of HVAC plants. The algorithms from various families of machine learning like linear models, function-based learning models, lazy learning techniques, and tree-based techniques were applied on the dataset obtained from a commercial building and the results were evaluated and compared based on performance metricsâ€”root mean square error, mean square error, mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination. The interpretation of results obtained shows that K-nearest neighbor model from lazy learning family outperforms other regression models with reduced errors and improved accuracy."
