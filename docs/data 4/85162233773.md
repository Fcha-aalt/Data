## Abstract
"Using sequential search optimisation technique in conjunction with Building Information Modeling, this research considers standards and easily implemented design and operational energy efficiency measures to improve the energy performance of prototype buildings in various climatic zones throughout the North African region. This work's novelty lies in developing advanced, comprehensive models to propose a new code for the building sector that considers different climatic zones and types of buildings already in use. In the analysis, design features of air-conditioned buildings are considered, including window glazing, wall construction, roof construction, degree of building orientation, window shades, air infiltration level, HVAC equipment efficiency, and lighting efficiency. Optimising designs compared to present building construction practices in the region may lower energy consumption by 31–56 per cent. The analysis's findings show that there is much room to enhance the energy performance of buildings in the North African region by implementing proven energy efficiency methods and relevant energy policies. The requirement for insulation of building envelope components, on the other hand, varies according to climatic zone and building type."
