## Abstract
"As global warming intensifies, appropriate policies are needed to encourage passive and energy efficient designs without sacrificing thermal comfort in buildings. Amongst building typologies, the residential sector has the highest energy demand growth, mostly caused by the introduction of new electrical appliances, with HVAC systems being the largest contributor. The Australian Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERS) aims to promote energy efficiency by rating houses based on annual heating and cooling load. However, houses with typical design components in warm climates are estimated by NatHERS to have higher cooling loads, thus lower house energy rating compared to identical houses in cooler climates. There are also gaps found between monitored energy consumption and simulation results, most markedly in individual projects, due to NatHERS assuming equivalent user behaviour across climates. This paper investigates the sensitivity of user behaviour related to their control on windows and blinds against cooling load calculation using AccuRate Sustainability, a NatHERS-certified computer simulation software. The quantified sensitivity of windows and blinds control are applied in cooling and free-running modes. The results for both modes showed that the lowest cooling loads and cooling degree hours can be achieved through the optimum usage of internal shading devices."
