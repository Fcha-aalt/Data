## Abstract
"This research investigates the vitality advantages and future capability of using Electrochromic Glazing (ECG) System in sustainable courtyards in residential buildings inside the climatic states of the Amman city at the concept stage.This research considers the applied methodology to improve sustainability of courtyard, considering solar irradiation and buildings energy needs for cooling and heating.The Revit “energy modeling software” programming is utilized to evaluate the energy efficiency, chiefly the decreases in lighting,”heating, ventilating, and air conditioning” (HVAC), for various states and contrast that to the regular glassThe study findings show that adding ECG system to courtyard reduces the energy consumption, therefore the building saves 25 % of the energy in clear state, and when the system is tinted, it saves 57,5% of the energy, this applies to the summer season. While in the case of winter, the ECG system is efficient in energy consumption with heating, the building saves 80% of energy consumption, which reduces the cost. The study concludes that the number of years needed to recover the price of ECG system is 7.8 years which means that the courtyard is a sustainable solution in residential design according to Revit Program and Enterprise Green Communities (EGC) standard"
