## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 91 papers. The topics discussed include: Reducio: model reduction for data center predictive digital twins via physics-guided machine learning; constrained differentiable cross-entropy method for safe model-based reinforcement learning; data-driven decarbonization of residential heating systems; understanding the willingness to share building data by a social study based on privacy calculus theory; accelerate online reinforcement learning for building HVAC control with heterogeneous expert guidances; cross-zone and extreme-aware mobility learning of crowd interactions with built environments; on efficient operation of a V2G-enabled virtual power plant: when solar power meets bidirectional electric vehicle charging; integrated MPC-ILC control design for thermal control of a large-scale variable air volume reheat systems in buildings; and an effective electrical load disaggregation approach for low-sampled smart meter data."
