## Abstract
"Integrating urban agriculture in buildings through rooftop greenhouses can increase the energy efficiency of a building. However, few studies have considered the load characteristics of greenhouses. This study developed and validated a greenhouse modeling methodology incorporating load characteristics such as thermal stratification, latent heat change due to plant transpiration and a fog system. An integrated rooftop greenhouse (iRTG) energy model was developed using the validated methodology for a medium office reference building. The methodology exhibited acceptable predictive performance. Energy savings from the passive effect of the iRTG and through iRTG-linked HVAC system using two-way air distribution method were 9% and 23%, respectively. This study can be a basis for introducing iRTGs and presenting their effectiveness."
