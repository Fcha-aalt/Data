## Abstract
"In a broad ranging a green building includes a building which is outline, constructed, operated, maintained and reuse by considering the maximum conservation of energy in all phases. First objective of a green building is related to human health, maximum use of natural resources, reduction in electrical energy consumption, maximum utilization of renewable energy and reduction of environmental pollutants. Reflective and systematic site design and expansion practices help to minimize the energy consumption and improve performance of a building. In this paper a case study on energy efficient with intelligent technique in construction and operation of newly constructed hospital building has been presented. Main purpose behind this study is to analysis the strategy is there in hospital green building where the scope of further minimization of electrical energy consumption and maximize the utilization of natural resources which results in maximum percentage of savings in energy. All the electrical instruments used in building are based on Energy Conservation Building Code and Bureau of Energy Efficiency rated. In this paper main focus is on HVAC system, Water Treatment Plant, Building Management System, Solar Water Heating System, Solid Waste Generation and Management and Sewage Treatment Plant."
