## Abstract
"5G mobile communication system achieve better network performance while causing a significant increase in energy consumption, which hinders the sustainable development of the telecom industry. Even with many efforts for energy efficient system designs and equipment operation are developed, there is still a plenty of potential for energy savings in HVAC operation of 5G base station site since a significant amount of energy is consumed for thermal management by the HVAC system to control the indoor environment within an acceptable temperature range for safe and reliable operation of the base station (BS) equipment. In this work, a coordinated optimization approach for energy efficient thermal management of 5G BS site is proposed. The approach collaboratively optimized the HVAC system and the BS equipment with MILP model. The application results show that the average energy costs savings in HVAC operation with the coordinated approach are 24.8%-32.5%, and the total BS site costs savings are more than 13%."
