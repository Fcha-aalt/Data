## Abstract
"The utilization of energy is on the rise in current trends due to increasing consumptions by households. Smart buildings, on the other hand, aim to optimize energy, and hence, the aim of the study is to forecast the cost of energy consumption in smart buildings by effectively addressing the minimal energy consumption. However, smart buildings are restricted, with limited power access and capacity associated with Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) units. It further suffers from low communication capability due to device limitations. In this paper, a balanced deep learning architecture is used to offer solutions to address these constraints. The deep learning algorithm considers three constraints, such as a multi-objective optimization problem and a fitness function, to resolve the price management problem and high-level energy consumption in HVAC systems. The study analyzes and optimizes the consumption of power in smart buildings by the HVAC systems in terms of power loss, price management and reactive power. Experiments are conducted over various scenarios to check the integrity of the system over various smart buildings and in high-rise buildings. The results are compared in terms of various HVAC devices on various metrics and communication protocols, where the proposed system is considered more effective than other methods. The results of the Li-Fi communication protocols show improved results compared to the other communication protocols."
