## Abstract
"Simultaneously managing energy consumption and ensuring a health environment in public shared buildings presents significant challenges. This study explores the use of advanced monitoring techniques and specific Z-Wave sensors to optimize building management systems. The focus is on maintaining air quality, minimizing energy usage, and achieving significant energy savings. Various sensor types are employed, and data collection and processing are performed through a central gateway. The methodology is tested in university buildings, demonstrating the potential for energy savings by dynamically interacting with HVAC systems based on occupancy levels. Effective monitoring and control strategies can contribute to improved energy efficiency and occupant well-being. In specific cases, most notably when the occupancy of rooms is low, energy consumption can be reduced by up to 70%."
