## Abstract
"Thermal comfort (TC) is the primary concern that is generally kept aside during HVAC system optimization. In this paper thermal comfort of the occupants is considered to higher priority with optimum energy saving. Firstly ambient climatic condition classification is done to control the indoor thermal condition. In addition, indoor thermal zone classification for a controller is bounded within the ISO standard given by ASHRAE. The proposed model incorporates ambient conditions and tariffs to get optimum thermal comfort. Moreover, the effect of ESS with PV, together with the proposed methodology, is presented."
