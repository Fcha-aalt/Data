## Abstract
"The optimization of multi-zone residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) control is not an easy task due to its complex dynamic thermal model and the uncertainty of occupant-driven cooling loads. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have recently been proposed to address the HVAC control problem. However, the application of single-agent DRL for multi-zone residential HVAC control may lead to non-convergence or slow convergence. In this paper, we propose MAQMC (Multi-Agent deep Q-network for multi-zone residential HVAC Control) to address this challenge with the goal of minimizing energy consumption while maintaining occupantsâ€™ thermal comfort. MAQMC is divided into MAQMC2 (MAQMC with two agents:one agent controls the temperature of each zone, and the other agent controls the humidity of each zone) and MAQMC3 (MAQMC with three agents:three agents control the temperature and humidity of three zones, respectively). The experimental results show that MAQMC3 can reduce energy consumption by 6.27% and MAQMC2 by 3.73% compared with the fixed point; compared with the rule-based, MAQMC3 and MAQMC2 respectively can reduce 61.89% and 59.07% comfort violation. In addition, experiments with different regional weather data demonstrate that the well-trained MAQMC RL agents have the robustness and adaptability to unknown environments."
