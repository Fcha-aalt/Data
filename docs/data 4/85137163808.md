## Abstract
"Controlling Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) in a way that is both optimal (energy efficient) and adaptive (able to cope with uncertainties) is a recognized challenge in the building sector. This work presents a simple modelling approach to HVAC operation aiming for adaptive and optimal control. The proposed framework exhibits several advantages amenable for implementation in energy management systems: minimum number of parameters to be estimated; preserving the distributed nature of multiple zones in the estimation process; easiness of imposing positivity and controllability constraints on the estimated coefficients. Optimality is addressed using an adaptive linear quadratic control philosophy. Comparisons with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and non-adaptive controllers show the capability of the proposed framework of coping with uncertainty while delivering nearly optimal controls."
