## Abstract
"The building analyzed is a structure where the facades are made mainly by wood, while the remaining is concrete reinforced. Building is mainly naturally ventilated on perimetral parts, while the middle areas such as toilets, kitchen and stores are air conditioned. Different energy efficiency techniques were applied to building envelopes and HVAC plants to reduce energy usage by the facility. The aim of this work is to identify the appropriate techniques to be applied for reducing building electricity consumption. Furthermore, analysis will include economical comparisons of these techniques to identify the best ones in terms costs and electricity savings. Three techniques were selected such as: Heat Pump time turning ON/OFF and replacement of motors and light with high efficiency ones. In conclusion, after applying the selected most suitable energy efficiency techniques, yearly electricity savings was about 30%, which correspond to 28260 kWh."
