## Abstract
"In this article, a novel drive mode, intelligent vehicle drive mode (IVDM), was proposed, which augments the vehicle engine performance in real-time. This drive mode predicts the driver behavior vector (DBV), which optimizes the vehicle engine performance, and the metric of optimal vehicle engine performance was defined using the elements of engine operating point (EOP) and heating ventilation and air conditioning system (HVAC). Deep learning (DL) models were developed by mapping the vehicle level vectors (VLV) with EOP and HVAC parameters, and the trained functions were utilized to predict the future states of DBV reflecting augmented vehicle engine performance. The iterative analysis was performed by empirically estimating the future states of VLV in the allowable range of DBV and was fed into the DL model to predict the performance vectors. The defined vehicle engine performance metric was applied to the predicted vectors, and thus optimal DBV is the instantaneous output of the IVDM. The analytical and validation techniques were developed using field data obtained from General Motors Inc., Warren, Michigan. Finally, the proposed concept was quantified by analyzing the instantaneous engine efficiency (IEE) and smoothness measure of the instantaneous engine map (IEM)."
