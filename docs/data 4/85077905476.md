## Abstract
"An innovative test bench has been developed in the framework of the Project CBET - Cross Border Energy Trainings, funded by the Interreg ALCOTRA 2014-2020 Program of the European Union and aimed to increase the educational, training and professional skills on energy efficiency, renewable energy sources and green buildings in the cross-border area between Italy and France. The test bench, called Maison CBET, consists of a transportable standard container modified in a heated, ventilated and air-conditioned habitable office. The opaque and glazed components of the thermal envelope can be easily modified from uninsulated to well insulated, with a wide range of options, as well as shielded against solar radiation. A complete HVAC system is also installed. This is based on electric devices that can be switched on selectively and are powered by separate power lines, continuously monitored by a real time data acquisition system. Weather data and internal comfort parameters are contemporarily monitored. This paper presents a prototype of the test bench that is currently under construction and will be installed in the campus of the Lycée Léonard de Vinci at Antibes, France."
