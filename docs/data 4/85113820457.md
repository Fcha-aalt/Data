## Abstract
"Testing the quality of manufactured products based on their sound expression is becoming popular nowadays. To maintain low production costs, the testing is processed at the end of the assembly line. Such measurements are affected considerably by the factory noise even though they are performed in anechoic chambers. Before designing the quality control algorithm based on a convolutional neural network, we do not know the influence of the factory noise on the success rate of the algorithm that can potentially be obtained. Therefore, this contribution addresses this problem. The experiments were undertaken on a synthetic dataset of heat, ventilation, and air-conditioning devices. The results show that classification accuracy of the decision-making algorithm declines more rapidly at a high level of environmental noise."
