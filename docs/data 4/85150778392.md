## Abstract
"The existing control methods have the problem of high average energy cost when controlling HVAC equipment in innovative parks, which does not meet the energy-saving control requirements. Therefore, this paper introduces deep learning and researches the design of AI intelligent control methods for energy-saving HVAC equipment in smart parks. This paper takes energy saving of HVAC equipment as the target and establishes a control model for minimizing energy cost in the smart park; uses deep learning to complete the calculation of thermal comfort control algorithms in the park, and realizes AI computing intelligent control of HVAC equipment through AI computing. Comparative experiments prove that applying the new intelligent control method can effectively reduce the average energy cost and thus obtain the energy-saving control effect."
