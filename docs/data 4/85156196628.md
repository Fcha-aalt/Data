## Abstract
"Digital Twin is one of the fast-growing technology digitalization space which needs to complete Smart City's problem areas. Digital twin is virtual representation of physical things or assets or process in a connected network. The data from Physical asset or things IOT Devices, Sensors, Cameras needs to be collected in a large cloud store which contains the engineering data like machine diagrams or flow charts, building blueprint, building electrical map or waterline map, Building information Model, 3D images, Computer Aided Design (CAD), controls data IOT Sensors, IOT Gateway, Drones, Cameras, etc. and supporting data. This research paper narrates the different types of digital twin with a use case of Smart Building and how it should be protected during disaster time with different technologies and dataset"
