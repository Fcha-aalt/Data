## Abstract
"The built environment has a significant environmental impact, contributing to the increasing effect of climate change. The energy saving of buildings is essential to achieve the sustainable objectives of the European Union. To do this, an adequate strategy can be the proper use of HVAC Systems. In this sense, adaptive slogan temperatures can be an opportunity to get savings. Although it has been shown that the application of adaptive slogan temperatures is an efficient measure of energy saving, the procedure for performing such simulations was not optimized until the development of the Python library called ‘Accim’. This chapter aims to explain in detail the functions and relationship between the different objects involved in the script. The energy savings expected through the analysis with the described methodology could lead to an achievement of the international sustainability objectives."
