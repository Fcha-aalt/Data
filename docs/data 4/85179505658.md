## Abstract
"A well-known control strategy from the process industry, model predictive control (MPC), is regarded as a promising avenue towards achieving smart operation of building HVAC systems, by enabling energy flexibility through the thermal mass of the building. Given sufficient models of the building envelope and HVAC-system, alongside predictions of future disturbances, it is possible to optimize the building control in a receding horizon fashion, thus achieving near-optimal control. However, a significant effort is required to deliver sufficient control models for building MPC. To this end, we will apply moving horizon estimation (MHE), in combination with reinforcement learning (RL), to deliver closed-loop state and parameter estimation, relaxing the need for exhaustive system identification (SID) prior to control deployment."
