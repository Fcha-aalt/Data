## Abstract
"Energy management is one of the most important challenges for humanity, and this requires primarily the evolution of people’s lifestyles. Today, the building sector represents the largest consumer of electrical energy in the world, as well as in Morocco with a rate of 25%. This energy consumption is expected to rise due to the significant increase in household equipment rates in HVAC facilities, especially air conditioners. So, reducing energy consumption in buildings is therefore a major economic and ecological challenge. This work has recently made a positive contribution to this issue by studying the effect of the use of overhangs and wings on the thermal comfort and energy performance of a typical Moroccan R+1 building in three different climates. This was achieved through the use of dynamic thermal simulation, which is performed by TRNSYS software. The results show that the use of overhangs and wings has made a positive contribution, firstly, to thermal comfort and, secondly, to the energy performance of the studied building in Marrakech, Casablanca and Tangier."
