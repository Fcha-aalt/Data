## Abstract
"Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) loads have great potential for demand response due to the buildings' thermal inertia. Modelling the complex thermal dynamics of realistic buildings is essential for the building energy optimization. In this paper, Deep Q-Network (DQN), a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, is used to decide the indoor temperature setpoint in response to the real-time price. The agent can adjust the HVAC load to reduce the electricity cost while considering the occupants' comfort requirement. To significantly accelerate the training process, imitation learning is adopted to pre-train the RL agent using historical data. The results of the case study show that the agent's performance improves steadily and exceeds the benchmark after a short period of training."
