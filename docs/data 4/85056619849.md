## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 23 papers. The topics discussed include: modal analysis of vertical wind turbine blade; the effect of lubrication on the vibration of roller bearings; attenuation of motorcycle handle vibration using dynamic vibration absorber; development of a lower limb stroke rehabilitation machine; structural dynamic analysis of the Chenderoh dam sector gate section; sound and vibration damping properties of nonwoven flax reinforced acrylic based polyester composites; whole body vibration analysis of baby hammock; modelling of the coupled beam-piezoelectric material with hysteresis non-linerity effect; investigation of damping coefficient for magnetorheological elastomer; full-field vibration measurement using camera through shearlet system; prediction of the flow-induced vibration response of the Chenderoh dam left bank section; an experimental study on the effect of surface texture on contact stiffness using soft material; numerical and experimental investigations of nonlinearity behaviour in a slender cantilever beam; measurement of the hissing-type noise and vibration of the automotive HVAC system; experimental identification on non linear properties of rubber mount; breathing sounds â€“ determination of extremely low SPL; and deep neural network tool chatter model for aluminum surface milling using acoustic emission sensor."
