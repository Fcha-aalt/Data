## Abstract
"A novel co-simulation framework was developed and demonstrated through virtual power plant (VPP) simulations that include hundreds of unique building models randomly populated into a modified IEEE 123-bus feeder system. The framework employs ultra-fast models for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems as well as building thermal envelopes that are satisfactorily accurate for both electric power and indoor temperature. The approach circumvents generic control time limits typically in conventional implementations by enabling occupant thermal comfort monitoring. The HVAC and building models contain parameters by which they are characterized as generalized energy storage (GES) systems based on Energy Star definitions. This enables their compatibility with the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) 2045 standard control commands and event types. Example CTA-2045 “shed” events are illustrated to exemplify this feature and to analyze power distribution system effects in terms of power flow and voltages."
