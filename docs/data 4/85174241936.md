## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 21 papers. The topics discussed include: a new formulation of the single species feedback control system; optimization of expert solutions for events forecasting; local splines of the zero and first degrees, and the solution of integral equation; a new paradigm in the control of HVAC system based on the comfort sensation scale; improvement object tracking process through filtering methods; on a structural approach to the complex systems conceptual modeling; anatomical inspection of similar articulations in Arabic language using dynamic MRI; on the controllability and observability of heterogeneous networked systems with distinct node dimensions and inner-coupling matrices; and tracking a holonomic mobile robot with systematic odometry errors; portable system for health hygiene monitoring."
