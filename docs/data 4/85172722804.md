## Abstract
"In the spring of 2020, an unprecedented global lockdown was implemented for controlling the spread of COVID-19 in many countries. In this case study, we utilized a dataset collected from a typical office building in Northern California to conduct analytics on the energy benchmarking and load shape, as well as the impact of occupancy on the energy consumption. We also investigated and compared the occupancy and energy use pattern before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The restriction on occupancy tends to reduce the energy consumption in office buildings, particularly on lighting and plug loads. However, the public health regulations on increasing ventilation rate and extending building operations to improve indoor air quality lead to the levelized or even increased HVAC energy use for maintaining the indoor air temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentration. This case study provides an example of how rich building datasets can be analysed using data-driven approaches to understand and improve the understanding of building operations towards a better building design and a more efficient operation."
