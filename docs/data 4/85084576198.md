## Abstract
"Real-time and effective human thermal discomfort detection plays a critical role in achieving energy efficient control of human centered intelligent buildings because estimation results can provide effective feedback signals to heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. How to detect occupant thermal discomfort is a challenge. Unfortunately, contact or semi-contact perception methods are inconvenient in practical application. From the contactless perspective, a kind of vision-based contactless human discomfort pose estimation method was proposed in this paper. Firstly, human pose data were captured from a vision-based sensor, and corresponding human skeleton information was extracted. Five thermal discomfort-related human poses were analyzed, and corresponding algorithms were constructed. To verify the effectiveness of the algorithms, 16 subjects were invited for physiological experiments. The validation results show that the proposed algorithms can recognize the five human poses of thermal discomfort."
