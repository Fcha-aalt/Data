## Abstract
"This article assesses the effects of the Ecodesign and energy labelling regulations with respect to space heating and cooling technologies. A detailed study of performance rating data over three years period (2014 - 2016) from an independent database of heating and cooling products on the European market is made. This enables to evaluate the energy efficiency evolution of these type of products and to identify how policies can further boost energy efficiency development and ensure its success. Results demonstrate the positive effects of the introduction of energy labels in the European market and the importance of reliable data. However, the facts presented suggest that adjustments on the requirements of minimum energy efficiency should be considered in the future revision of the ecodesign regulations and highlight the importance of reliable data to avoid jeopardizing the energy saving potential of these mechanisms."
