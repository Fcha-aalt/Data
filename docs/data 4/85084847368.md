## Abstract
"Chillers consume considerable energy in building HVAC systems, and the optimal operation of chillers is essential for energy conservation in buildings. This article proposes a model-free optimal chiller loading (OCL) method for optimizing chiller operation. Unlike model-based OCL methods, the proposed method does not require accurate chiller performance models as a priori knowledge. The proposed method is based on the Q-learning method, a classical reinforcement learning method. With the comprehensive coefficient of performance (COP) of chillers as the environmental feedback, the model-free loading controller can learn autonomously and optimize the chiller loading by adjusting the set points of the chilled water outlet temperature. A central chiller plant in an office building located in Shanghai is selected as a case system to investigate the energy conservation performance of the proposed method through simulations. The simulation results suggest that the proposed method can save 4.36% of chiller energy during the first cooling season compared to the baseline control, which is slightly inferior to the value for the model-based loading method (4.95%). Owing to its acceptable energy-saving capability, the proposed method can be applied to central chiller plants that lack a system model and historical data."
