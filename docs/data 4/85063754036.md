## Abstract
"A “performance gap” arises when the actual value of building energy consumption during the operational phase deviates from the value predicted using simulation during the design phase. One cause of this performance gap is that operation is not ideal, as assumed in the simulation, and the control of the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) system is not optimized. These problems occur because the operator has not been trained sufficiently and/or the building automation system is not working as intended by the developer. Both problems are fundamentally caused by the fact that the quality of building operation cannot be quantitatively evaluated by comparison with other buildings because a building is a heterogenous, single-item product. To address the performance gap problem, we developed a method for quantitatively evaluating building operation using a precise simulation based on a thermal environment emulator. The emulator software was developed using the BACnet protocol as an interface to the real world and includes an occupant behavior model to enable the assessment of operation in terms of thermal comfort as well as energy performance. In this paper, we report on the program and network structure of the proposed emulator. In addition, we show the concrete results of changing the operational control, and we assess changes in energy performance and comfort from the perspective of Pareto efficiency."
