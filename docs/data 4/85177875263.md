## Abstract
"In recent years, various novel control methods have been shown to improve the energy efficiency of HVAC systems significantly, utilizing feedback from the cooled location to control the cooling effects. Despite this, the inflexibility of standard HVAC systems limits the potential energy savings. In this work, the performance of an easily retro-fitted smart adaptive vent system which was designed to overcome this inflexibility is studied. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to evaluate and compare the smart adaptive vent system against a standard diffuser. The directed airflow possible with the smart adaptive vent improved occupant thermal comfort under the same airflow rates at a cost of increased draft rates. The average PMV for all occupants were noted to reach a comfortable value at ~58% faster timeframe. The results demonstrate that the smart adaptive vent is capable of achieving greater thermal comfort at a similar or lower airflow rate, consequently improving the energy efficiency of the HVAC system."
