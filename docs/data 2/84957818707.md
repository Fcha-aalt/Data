## Abstract
"Making buildings more energy efficient while keeping thermal comfort has been an important topic in last decades, including improving efficiency of Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. One approach to this goal is to use better control methods. This paper presents a review of methods which have been researched in scientific papers in last couple of years. Most papers focus on one of the following trends: improving 'classical' control methods; use of predictable control based on models; use of intelligent control methods."
