## Abstract
"Control approaches of HVAC systems in buildings have been proposed in the past years for minimizing energy consumption and maintaining occupants' comfort. However, recent studies have shown that context-driven control approaches using IoT and Big Data technologies could further improve energy consumption of HVAC systems. In this paper, an intelligent control approach using a state-feedback technique is introduced to regulate the HVAC system according to the actual context. The performance of the proposed control was evaluated in a real test site by deploying a control card that links the controller with the HVAC system. A smart application for real feedback control was also developed and deployed to dynamically adapt the controller to context's changes. Experiments results are reported to demonstrate that this approach is effective in term of energy saving while maintaining a comfortable room temperature."
