## Abstract
"Indiaâ€™s growing economy and increasing demand for electricity has strongly increased challenge for grid-based systems for effective generation and transmission of energy. As energy management has become a worldwide concern, the heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems which constitute a significant part of annual total energy consumption in the world needs to be controlled. This work aims for the better energy management of HVAC systems by using different control strategies. Conventional controlling techniques like ON-OFF, Proportional, PI, PID controllers are used and compared with Artificial Intelligence techniques namely Fuzzy controller for the efficient use of HVAC system. The hardware circuit, QNET-HVAC has been taken as model for real time HVAC systems and control techniques are implemented for better temperature management."
