## Abstract
"Energy Efficiency is an important aspect in the construction of a residential building. Energy Consumption in the building is approximately 8% of electricity and 3.5% of the natural gas. As the increasing in consumption will increase the environmental damage as well as the building interior climatic condition. Heat, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system and lightning system are the major factors that influence energy consumption. In the same way there are climatic issues along with global warming which cannot sustain current economic development activities. So, as to reduce the environmental damage and to make the building energy efficient, certain green techniques must be recommended. By keeping this in view, the paper deals with the case study on residential building and identifying the causes where heavy energy consumption is done and taking them in to consideration and also suggesting green efficiency recommendations for an existing building."
