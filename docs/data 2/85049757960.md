## Abstract
"Dynamic cooling and heating load forecasting of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems is a basis for optimizing the operation of HVAC systems and can contribute to achieving the effective management for the HVAC systems. This paper proposes a load forecasting method for office buildings based on artificial intelligence and regression analysis, including wavelet transform, support vector machines (SVM), and partial least squares regression (PLS). An office building located in Tianjin, China is taken as the building case study to validate the proposed model. For selecting the input variables, the methods of sensitivity analysis and correlation analysis are used. The results of different prediction horizons, mainly including 1 h ahead, 2 h ahead, 3 h ahead and 24 h ahead forecasting, are finally provided. In order to illustrate the accuracy improvement of the proposed model, the other three models are built to compare with the proposed model. Further, the influence of weather forecast precision on the proposed model is analyzed in this paper. The results indicate that the proposed method can realize dynamic load forecasting with high accuracy for different time horizons."
