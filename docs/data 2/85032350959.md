## Abstract
"This paper provides a comparative study of the energy consumption and energy efficiency of a HVAC system with three configurations. This system was used to cool an experimental room in an office building in more control scenarios realized by adopting different cooled water temperatures and chiller cooling systems. It is proposed an air–water mist cooled system for an air-cooled chiller. The three configurations of the HVAC system have the following configurations: (1) air handling unit (AHU) and fan-coil units (FCUs); (2) air handling unit (AHU); and (3) heat recovery unit (HRU) and fan-coil units (FCUs). It is analyzed electricity consumption weight of the equipment of each HVAC system and the total energy consumption. The results of the experiments indicate that the optimal efficiency HVAC system in office buildings includes an AHU and FCUs with an air–water mist cooled chiller and a cooled water temperature of 8°C. Finally, a TRNSYS simulation model of energy consumption and energy efficiency indices for the AHU&FCUs system is developed and experimentally validated. This study analyzed also the influence of the HVAC system to the thermal comfort through the values of the predicted mean vote (PMV) and predicted percentage of dissatisfied persons (PPD)."
