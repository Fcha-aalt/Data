## Abstract
"In Europe around forty percent of energy is consumed for the heating and cooling of buildings. Buildings are particularly interesting, because often considerable success in saving energy can be achieved by simple measures in terms of energy consumption and emissions. The key element for an energy efficient building is knowing how to recover heat in the ventilation system. During the winter a part of the energy which is in the exhaust air can be transferred to the supply air with a heat exchanger, so that no or only a lower reheating system is required, whereas during the summer the exhaust air can be used for pre-cooling of the supply air, but it must be ensured that supply air is not being heated up by the exhaust air. In this paper, the optimal heat recovery efficiency of an air handling unit with a heat exchanger is examined. Therefore, the effects of freezing and bypass circuit are taken into account. The calculations for two different insulation levels and two scenarios for the internal loads (small and high internal loads) are also analyzed. Finally, the size of the window is set for selected calculations on values between 30 and 70 percent of the total room's surface area. For the simulation of the building, physics and HVAC-systems, the object-oriented programming language Modelica is used, in which all components of a supply system are simulated. The simulation results show that the heat recovery fate of a heat exchanger should be selected carefully, because in both cases (an under and over-dimensioning of the heat exchanger) additional expenditure is caused. Generally it is assumed that a large heat recovery system helps to save energy. However, our results show that the optimum is found for a heat recovery of around 60 percent."
