## Abstract
"Ice thermal storage system is a novel technology used in HVAC&R systems for improving energy efficiency of manufacturing facilities. In this paper, the investigation of ice formation in a typical ice thermal storage system was conducted to study the factorial effect of the new structure of thin layer ring placed in a rectangular cavity filled with water on solidification process. Numerical method was used for the computational solutions of fluid flow domain. The performance of the thin layer ring was successfully demonstrated by achieving an increased ice generation area and shortening the time period of ice formation for a typical ice thermal storage system. More detailed research on material, thickness and arrangement of the ring has been comparatively conducted for heat transfer enhancement. The parameters of thin layer ring from three perspectives have been investigated statistically with nine combinations of model are carried out by combining different levels of each factor via Taguchi Method. The results show the contribution ratio of each factor of thin layer ring on improving energy efficiency of ice thermal storage system."
