## Abstract
"A facility performance evaluation (FPE) study was applied to an occupied office building in Mongolia that would be replaced by a new building. The purpose was to identify indoor environmental quality (IEQ) problems and possible solutions in the current building to inform the design and operation of the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system for the new building. The results show that the IEQ of the current building was poor due to high temperature, very low humidity and high CO2 concentration, and that the poor thermal uniformity and indoor air quality had caused the occupants' discomfort. Opening windows by the occupants in winter was one of the problems that affected the thermal comfort and the energy efficiency of the building. Based on the findings of the FPE, this study recommended the design and operation strategies of the HVAC system for the new building to improve its IEQ."
