## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 31 papers. The special focus in this conference is on Active Noise Control and Active Vibration Control. The topics include: A higher-order spectra based method of on-line secondary path model identification for active noise control systems; active casing controlled with a partial-update neural network; employment of double-panel casing for active reduction of device noise; the system for active control of sound transmission through a window panel; topology optimization of a bounded space for a vibroacoustical problem in a low frequency; vibration measurements for active noise control in a HVAC system with a passive; virtual microphone control for an active noise-cancelling casing; extended kalman filter in 2S1 tracked vehicle system with hybrid control; effectiveness of the sliding mode control in a two coupled discontinuous dynamical systems with dry friction; a novel backstepping approach for the attenuation of torsional oscillations in drill strings; a comparison of active and semi-active sliding mode controllers applied in vibration reduction systems; semi-active reduction of vibrations of periodically oscillating system; reduction methods of structure models for control system purposes; optimal controller for active vehicle suspension disturbed by sinusoidal signals; an analysis of axial vibration in face packing seals; balance maintaining by human; hybrid simulation of tracked vehicle suspension on real-time environment; output-only identification of vibratory machine suspension parameters under exploitational conditions; rock bolts health monitoring using self-excited phenomenon and analysis of selected pressure signal descriptors used to control combustion engine."
