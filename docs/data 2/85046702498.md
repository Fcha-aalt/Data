## Abstract
"This paper proposes a model-based framework to estimate the theoretical energy saving potential offered by CO2-based demand-controlled ventilation systems in buildings. For this purpose, the energy consumption of different heating ventilation air conditioning (HVAC) system configurations is compared for different occupancy scenarios. Physics-based models are used to describe the environmental conditions in the building and to estimate the energy consumption of the HVAC system. In order to guarantee optimality, the HVAC system is controlled by an optimal control approach aiming to minimize the energy consumption and to satisfy the comfort requirements."
