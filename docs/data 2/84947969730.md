## Abstract
"This article describes the development of an energy benchmarking, measurement, and verification (M&V) program for an existing research laboratory (RL) building located in western New York.The results of the development of the RL building energy end-use profiles and energy benchmarking using the Labs21 benchmarking tool are presented. This article describes how targeted energy efficiency measures (EEMs) can noticeably reduce an existing lab building's annual energy consumption. The article demonstrates that even with a traditional HVAC design, the optimization of operational system parameters can result in measurable energy savings.The significance of energy data normalization using regression analysis for evaluating RL building energy performance is emphasized. The results can be used as a case study for streamlining energy performance evaluations and minimizing energy use of existing laboratories."
