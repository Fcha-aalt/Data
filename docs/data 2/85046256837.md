## Abstract
"Ammonia has been widely used as the refrigerant of choice in industrial refrigeration for more than a century; however, the technology used has not undergone any major changes during that time. With growing pressure to improve safety and increase energy efficiency, low charge ammonia systems in particular have been gaining popularity. While the concept of low charge is not new, it represents the leading disruptor in the traditional industrial refrigeration market. This new technology is also leading to ammonia being considered for applications where it has traditionally not been used, such as HVAC and food retail. This paper outlines the market, technology and policy trends for the low charge ammonia technology in Europe, North America, Japan and China, drawing conclusions from a global study on low charge ammonia. It will also propose a definition for what constitutes a \"low charge\" system, and an overview of case studies, indicating potential new markets for ammonia."
