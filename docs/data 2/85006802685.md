## Abstract
"Energy Conservation projects have become a focus area throughout the world in an attempt to reduce greenhouse gasses. These projects encompass various energy efficient technologies of which the retrofit of old technologies with new technology has become a common phenomenon. Energy savings are usually quantified by comparing actual post-retrofit energy consumption levels with baseline levels representative of the preretrofit status quo, adjusted for changes in energy drivers (e.g. weather). Baseline adjustments during energy conservation projects are of the utmost importance if operating conditions, occupancies, ambient temperatures, production levels and other factors have changed between the baseline period and the post-retrofit period. During a recent case study in South Africa, an HVAC retrofit was done on a multistorey building where old technology air-conditioners were replaced with heat pump based units with inverters. To the disappointment of the landlord, the post energy measurements exceeded the baseline energy consumption by approximately 12% without any changes in operating conditions. This paper illustrates the catastrophic effects when an energy efficiency project is accelerated to the implementation stage without due consideration of operating conditions during the pre-implementation stage. A qualitative analysis prior to baseline establishment is proposed."
