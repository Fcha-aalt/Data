## Abstract
"Energy consumption strongly depends on the occupants' behavior for all types of buildings. However, the impact is greatly increased in high performance building, in which users can freely interact with the envelope system (opening widows and shading management) and with the HVAC control systems. The robustness of a design solution to suboptimal user's behaviors can thus become a distinguishing factor among different design alternatives. One of the main issues regards the predictability of user choices and actions and its codification into a plausible simulating algorithm. Several strategies are presented in the literature, however energy modelers adopted to a large extent the schedule approach, to take into account users in energy simulations. This paper describes two stochastic methods implemented in EnergyPlus to simulate the users' behaviors in managing opening surfaces and thermostat setpoint temperatures. Using these methods, the impact of different user behavior on the energy performance of a multistory building is investigated. The aim of this work is to quantify the impact of users' behavior modeling on the results of dynamic energy simulations."
