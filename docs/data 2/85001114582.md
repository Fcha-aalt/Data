## Abstract
"Common energy management control systems (EMCS) in building HVAC systems could be made much more energy efficient without sacrificing comfort. Most researchers have focused on implementing optimal control algorithms in Variable Air Volume (VAV) systems with EMC functions. Previous studies have paid little attention to using terminal box EMC functions integrated with main AHU (Air Handling Unit) systems. Terminal boxes with EMCS may cause occupant discomfort and waste excessive energy if they do not have the proper operation control functions. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of energy consumption and estimate building energy savings on the optimal minimum air flow of single duct VAV terminal boxes and develop applicable optimal terminal box control algorithms for EMCS. This paper presents a dynamic model of a VAV terminal box with hydronic reheat, develops optimal terminal box control algorithms and applies the developed EMCS algorithms to an actual building. The results of this study show that optimal terminal box control algorithms can stably maintain the set room air temperature and reduce energy consumption for varying heating loads compared to conventional control algorithms.."
