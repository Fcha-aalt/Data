## Abstract
"The paper presents a technique for detection classification and diagnosis of fault location on overhead transmission lines for different types of fault. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) has been used for extraction of features of signals of current under faulted condition and back propagation neural network (BPNN) have been used for training the features of current signal for different fault location. It has been found that the coefficients of discrete wavelet transform of fault signal and BPNN satisfactorily detect, classify and locate the fault location."
