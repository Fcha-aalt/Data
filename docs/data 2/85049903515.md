## Abstract
"The standard electric motors have devoted themselves a large share of total energy consumption in the world due to high electric consumption. One of the alternative solution to reduce energy consumption in mechanical systems that have large numbers of motor like HVAC system is using high efficient electric motor. Application of high efficient motor saving in this study presents investigation of energy saving, energy saving cost, payback period, and emission reduction by using efficient motors replacement to standard motors of HVAC system in one hospital in Malaysia (UKMMC). It was found that a considerable energy saving values for different loads (50%, 75%, and 100%) could be achieved by replacing the high efficient motors to standard motors. During the one year, total energy savings have been measured for different loads as 122.5, 120.9, and 99 MWh respectively. Also, it has been estimated that amounts of energy saving cost for different loads are US$12,244, US$12,095, and US$9,893. The best size and amount of payback period, and energy saving, saving cost and emission reduction was found for 50% load."
