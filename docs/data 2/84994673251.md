## Abstract
"The reduction of vehicle interior noise has long been the main interest of NVH engineers. Among the various types of vehicle interior noise, HVAC system noise has a great influence on vehicle acoustical comfort and on overall quality perception of a vehicle. In this research, the noise of a vehicle HVAC system was studied using methods and techniques of sound quality engineering. Noise samples were taken from a vehicle as the evaluation objects and subjective evaluation test was carried out with the Paired-comparison method. In addition, multiple regression, back propagation neural network and support vector machine (SVM) models were generated respectively by using four numerical inputs of the objective sound quality metrics, including sound pressure level, loudness, sharpness, and roughness, and one numerical output of subjective response results (\"Annoyance\"). Results demonstrate that the SVM model predicts the subjective response result \"Annoyance\" more accurately than traditional methods, and the reliability value is calculated as 0.998 by using statistical analysis. It provides an appropriate method to estimate the sound quality of vehicle HVAC system noise and obviously improve the prediction accuracy. Moreover, it is also found that there is a weak nonlinear relationship between the subjective and objective evaluation results."
