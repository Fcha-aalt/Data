## Abstract
"One of the main inefficiencies in building management systems is the widespread use of schedule-based control when operating heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. HVAC systems typically operate on a pre-designed schedule that heats or cools rooms in the building to a set temperature even when rooms are not being used. Occupants, however, influence the thermal behavior of buildings. As a result, using occupancy information for scheduling meetings to occur at specific times and in specific rooms has significant energy savings potential. As shown in Lim et al. [15], combining HVAC control with meeting scheduling can lead to substantial improvements in energy efficiency. We extend this work and develop an approach that scales to larger problems by combining mixed integer programming (MIP) with large neighborhood search (LNS). LNS is used to destroy part of the schedule and MIP is used to repair the schedule so as to minimize energy consumption. This approach is far more effective than solving the complete problem as a MIP problem. Our results show that solutions from the LNS-based approach are up to 36% better than the MIP-based approach when both given 15 minutes."
