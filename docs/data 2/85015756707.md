## Abstract
"This paper presents a novel heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning system that can achieve significant energy savings. A smart register that can reduce overall energy costs by up to 30%, compared to conventional devices, is demonstrated. A high abstraction model based on a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation is developed to predict the diffused airflow from the register. The model is validated to within a 10% error, and is found to be 1000 times more efficient than the detailed CFD simulations. Finally, a prototype of the electroactive smart air-conditioning vent register is implemented, and adjustments of the register's tunnels are implemented."
