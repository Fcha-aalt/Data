## Abstract
"Electric motors are the universal drivers of HVAC components. With a few exceptions, such as steam turbine-driven chillers and combustion engine driven chillers, electric motors, ranging in size from fractional horsepower to thousands of horsepower, provide the driving forces for HVAC systems. Many different types of motors are suitable for many conditions such as high and low temperature, moisture, high humidity, and/or corrosive or explosive environment."
