## Abstract
"To condition a large-scale room, featured by high height as well as large indoor space, consumes energy heavily, thus in order to improve the energy efficiency of the air-conditioning system for a large-scale space, one needs to monitor the temperature distribution accurately since the load in the large-scale space may not be evenly distributed, a number of sensors are needed to monitor the temperature distribution. As \"wire sensors confront many difficulties in installation and maintenance, wireless sensor network (WSN) is proposed due to its high flexibility of installation as well as easy expandability. The objective of this study is to monitor the temperature profile in a selected large indoor space aided with WSN, and the data collected from the site was analyzed and summarized. It was found that the temperature was fluctuated between 23.5°C and 25.5°C and followed a similar pattern by analyzing the data collected; the corridor west and east were overcooled while other areas such as corridor north and coffer area were slightly undercooled. The temperature difference at the breathing level was always around 2°C, and consequently thermal comfort cannot be ensured by all of the occupants for the existing HVAC system in this space. This case study proved that WSN can be used in large indoor space for better monitoring and it would be an energy efficient solution to retrofit existing HVAC systems in the future."
