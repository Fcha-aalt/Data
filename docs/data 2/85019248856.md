## Abstract
"The building facade and perimeter zone represents a complex design integration challenge due to the diverse array of design and functional requirements paired with the increasing number of energy and environmental objectives set by design teams seeking to achieve a low-energy design concept that simultaneously supports a high level of indoor environmental quality. As designers seek to integrate daylighting within an efficient whole-building energy strategy, it is challenging to manage trade-offs between performance objectives such as envelope thermal performance, lighting and HVAC energy demand with human factors such as visual comfort, daylight availability, visual connection to the outdoors, and personal control. This requires an integrated approach to the application of technology, informed at a fundamental level by empirical knowledge of end-user needs. The following sections define four key areas of advancement for daylighting technologies that have the potential to help enable high-performance daylit buildings with enhanced indoor environmental quality."
