## Abstract
"In the last 15 years, Lombardy Region has supported numerous measures for energy efficiency and installation of renewable energy sources within its territory, including the realization and the upgrade of district heating plants, the installation of solar thermal systems, the energy retrofit of existing buildings, the promotion of zero emissions buildings and the improvement of efficient heating systems. All the interventions were analysed in the framework of a wide monitoring campaign aimed at evaluating impacts, effectiveness, pros and cons of the several supporting programs. The most important characteristics, conditions and technical features of these interventions were analysed. The results obtained are described in the present work in terms of environmental, energy and economic performances, taking into account the public expenditure and the investment costs. Results demonstrate that, referring to the analysed context, these initiatives were globally effective. Many lessons were learned by such experience and interesting suggestions could be consequently provided in the field of local energy policies towards the improvement of the energy and environmental performances of communities and territories."
