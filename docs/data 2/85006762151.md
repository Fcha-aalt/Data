## Abstract
"In this paper, we have conducted a brief study of present assessment of HVAC system in AVBR hospital, Wardha by carrying out detailed energy audit in AVBRH premises with systematic methodology specified as per Bureau of Energy efficiency (BEE). By conducting an investigation of the energy consumption, the energy audit focuses mainly on the equipment consumption, especial on air-conditioning system, electronically equipments, lighting system, and elevators, etc On the other hand proper handling of HVAC system for improving better performance of HVAC can also result in saving of energy. The energy consumption of the air-conditioning system is at the first place, which accounts for about 45%. The energy consumption of the lighting system is just less than 10%. Some measures are put forward to increase energy efficiency. Thereby our objective is to achieve energy conservation through rearranging and replacing earlier HVAC system by some new efficient one."
