## Abstract
"Our high-tech twenty-first century is, in particular, also the century of “small power supply systems” due to the use of advanced information and communication technologies in energy networks. Creation of combined systems called Smart Grid opens great prospects for the development of both of these industries (energy and IT) and is intended to provide a synergistic effect through IT-brokered power generation and distribution. This overview and position paper examines existing models of Smart Grid, the suitable basic networking and service technologies, as well as typical usage scenarios for integrated intelligent networks."
