## Abstract
"Due to developmental need of humankind, growing trend of energy generation and consumption results more and more Green House Gas emissions, which contribute significantly to the phenomena of Climate Change and Global Warming. The issue is further compounded by huge ash generation from thermal power plants. Judicious utilization of such waste in a greener way is another challenge. It is estimated that by 2030, 40.8% of Indian population shall be living under Urban environment, and huge no. of dwelling units would be required. Sand, being one of the conventional constituent of Concrete, and also the non-renewable soft mineral, is being mined mindlessly across the Globe. The energy consumed by building sector is around 40% of global energy use. HVAC load is the major contributor in overall energy profile in buildings situated under Hot & Humid climatic zones in tropical countries. Solar heat gain is resulted through building envelope, and the conventional concrete and plastered masonry surfaces contribute significantly to the same. An experimental work has been carried out to produce sustainable energy efficient concrete with Portland Pozzolana Cement, Sand, Coal Ash from Thermal Power Plant, Stone aggregate and water. Test samples are prepared with reducing quantities of Sand and increasing quantities of Coal Ash for a Design Mix Concrete. While characteristic strength of concrete could be achieved with replacement of Sand by Coal Ash, thermal conductivity value of concrete is reduced, while compared with normal concrete of same Mix."
