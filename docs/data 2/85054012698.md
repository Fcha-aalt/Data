## Abstract
"Green roof is defined as a vegetative roof system that contains live plants atop the roof membrane of buildings. Benefits of green roofs have already been addressed in the literature with regards to energy efficiency of buildings, thermal efficiency of roofs, improvements on the urban drainage, and extended lifespan of roof. The goal of this study is to propose an automated green roof system powered by solar energy; using grey water and condensed water from the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. A preliminary study was performed in Commerce, Texas during summer season from April to October, 2017 to test the feasibility of green roofs in East Texas climate. Ice Plant, New Gold Lantana, Purple Trailing Lantana, and White Trailing Lantana were planted onto 4 inches' medium. Thermal data were recorded to examine the cooling impact of the green roofs. The field study showed that the temperature below the green roof trays are significantly lower than open surface temperature at the roof (paired t-test, at alpha=0.05, p-value<0.0001). It implies that a conceptual automated green roof system can significantly reduce energy consumption of a building by lowering its surface temperature."
