## Abstract
"Hospital operating room HVAC systems require high quantities of circulated air to meet ASHRAE Standard 1701 and the non-aspirating flow requirements of the operating room. The typical HVAC system is highly ineffective, in terms of energy use, at maintaining the desirable temperature and humidity conditions of the space. This article will demonstrate that a version of a dual duct HVAC system will save considerable amounts of operational energy compared to the standard system."
