## Abstract
"HVAC commissioning is one of the most efficient processes to minimize energy waste and reducing performance gap by verifying and documenting building's entire systems. It is reported that building energy consumption can be reduced up to 20-40% and most building system deficiencies can be addressed through HVAC commissioning. Despite these benefits, it is often challenging to analyze and quantify building's energy savings of new building project through commissioning due to it is not easy to compare and analyze the actual energy use data and designed/calculated energy consumption. In this study, a case study of new building's HVAC commissioning was carried out the part of LEED Certification proceeding, and the commissioning results were compared and analyzed against designed/calculated energy consumption. The comparison data were used for evaluating dynamic simulation model and energy reduction achievement by HVAC commissioning. Through this paper, it shows that HAVC commissioning is possible to propose the energy reduction with reducing performance gap. Within this paper, the case study building's energy saving was achieved by 5.3% through HVAC commissioning."
