## Abstract
"Sensing and management of building systems became very exploited over the last decades, as well as the applications that enhance occupant comfort and energy efficiency in Smart Spaces. These are defined as a sensing and computing infrastructure employed to perceive and respond to human activity. Focusing on a real use case, we present a Big Data architecture in the cloud to enable the value extraction from the IoT to near-real time control for HVAC comfort in Smart Buildings. This elastic architecture enables a huge improvement over the off-line platform for data analytics and presents a novel integration of cloud services dedicated to Smart Spaces."
