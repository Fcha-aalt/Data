## Abstract
"There is evidence that food retail has shifted towards smaller stores and food products requiring less time for cooking. Small supermarkets (<400m2) usually located within urban areas have higher energy intensity than larger supermarkets because of the high ratio of food against non-food products. An energy and thermal small supermarket model was developed based on EnergyPlus using a coupling approach on the interdependence of subsystems and verifiedwith operational data. Simulations ofenergy efficient retrofits indicate savings of up to 17% with integrated improvements of building design, lighting, refrigeration and HVAC systems. Analysis of refrigeration type and food ratios indicates reduction of total and refrigeration energy consumption with decreasing frozen foods, but increase for the HVAC system making its choice more critical. Location within the urban heat island also has a small impact on the total energy use more pronounced for the HVAC and depending on the refrigeration system."
