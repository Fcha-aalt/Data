## Abstract
"There is no lack of studies on \"net zero energy buildings\" (\"nZEB\"). However, the vast majority of these studies focus on theories and simulation. The actual operational performance of \"net zero energy building\" during occupation has been largely overlooked by previous studies. This study aims to investigate the operational performance of net \"zero energy buildings\" via the case study of an office building in Tianjin, China. Using simulation, the energy consumption of the building at design phase was estimated and a solar photovoltaic (PV) system was selected. A whole year operation of the occupied building showed that energy consumption of the case building was much higher than the energy generated from the solar PV system. This was mainly due to three issues. Firstly, the equipment was different in terms of category, quantity and running time between operation and design stages, leading to considerable underestimate of energy consumption at the design stage. Secondly, the operational strategies need to be further improved in order to regulate users' behaviors. Thirdly, the efficiency of solar PV system was substantially reduced due to poor atmospheric environment (i.e. haze weather). Therefore, during the design process of \"net zero energy buildings\", it is imperative to ensure that the energy simulation accurately reflects how the building will actually operate once occupied. The research also revealed other barriers to the design and implementation of \"nZEB\" in China, such as extra efforts required for effective communicating the capacity of the HVAC design and systems to clients, and the increased cost of \"nZEB\" (e.g. solar PV system) particularly for public buildings. Finally, the solar radiation intensity of standard year adopted in the simulation needs to be replaced by the most recent meteorological data."
