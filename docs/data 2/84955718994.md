## Abstract
"Conventional direct load-shedding for achieving static voltage stability lacks considerations on both customer comfort and energy efficiency, resulting in higher cost and emission. A novel security-based, optimal load-shedding strategy considering customer comfort settings is presented in this paper. A temperature priority list method is used to model the virtual generator (VG) consisting of thermostatically controlled appliances (TCAs). To illustrate the control process and performance evaluation of the proposed load-shedding scheme, a modified IEEE 6-bus test system is used. Three heat, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) groups are numerically simulated to respond to optimal load shedding signals. Reduced responsive load population, variations of temperature dead-bands, and different outdoor temperature profiles are modeled to evaluate the capacity variations of the VG and its control performance. The results demonstrate that TCAs can provide satisfactory voltage stability."
