## Abstract
"This book focuses on some of the most energy-consuming HVAC systems; illuminating huge opportunities for energy savings in buildings that operate with these systems. The main discussion is on, cutting-edge decision making approaches, and algorithms in: decision making under uncertainty, genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks, agent based modeling, and game theory. These methods are applied to HVAC systems, in order to help designers select the best options among the many available pathways for designing and the building of HVAC systems and applications. The discussion further evolves to depict how the buildings of the future can incorporate these advanced decision-making algorithms to become autonomous and truly ‘smart’."
