## Abstract
"The main driving factor in determining control settings of an air conditioning system is indoor thermal condition and its association with occupants' satisfaction. In recent years, the ubiquity of computing devices has led to techniques for learning personalized thermal comfort by using feedback through smartphones or (commonly wearable) sensors to measure physiological variables. In this paper, seeking a non-contact and non-intrusive approach, we are investigating whether computers could visually identify human thermal comfort by using digital videos. This investigation has been conducted in the form of developing a specialized image processing algorithmic framework, which relies on Eulerian image magnification approach. This approach amplifies subtle changes in the human physiological signals that are associated with thermoregulation. The proposed framework has been evaluated through experimental studies on human subjects in a thermal chamber with hot and cold thermal conditions. The quantified results demonstrated that the proposed framework has effectively identified the thermoregulation states of the human subjects."
