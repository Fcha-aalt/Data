## Abstract
"Housing stock is one of the major energy consumers in Europe, or the Czech Republic respectively, and it is not easy to reach European 20/20/20 target with an envelope insulation only. Therefore a deep renovation alternative consisting of prefabricated insulating panels, implementation new smart HVAC systems and use of renewable energy sources is presented. In this article, boundary conditions and limitations of various aspects of such solution are described and the possible use is shown, particularly on a reference building in Milevsko, Czech Republic, representing the most common Czech multi-family housing sample."
