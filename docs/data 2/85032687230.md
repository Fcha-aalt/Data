## Abstract
"Joint electricity predictor and controller (JEPAC) is a system that allows energy suppliers to better predict their electricity grid activity and then, optimize their energy production, management and distribution. In fact, the more accurate the prediction is, the lesser its negative impact on the economy and environment. Once the JEPAC system is installed in the energy consumer place, it will collect indoor ambient parameters and energy usage and thus predict the individual future consumption. This prediction will be frequently transmitted to the energy supplier as a formatted commitment then later, the same device will try to respect this commitment by adjusting wisely the userâ€™s appliances and HVAC. As a result, the energy supplier will then crowdsource the global energy demand by aggregating highly detailed individual consumption commitments. This will allow a better prediction and control of the future energy demand."
