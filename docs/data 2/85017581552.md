## Abstract
"In this chapter, we describe a mean-field control method to improve energy efficiency for operating the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. To illustrate the idea of this method, we consider a distributed setpoint temperature regulation problem for building HVAC systems. With a large number of zones in large buildings, the problem becomes intractable with standard control approaches due to the large state space dimension of the dynamic model. To mitigate complexity, we apply the mean-field control approach to large-scale control problems in buildings. The mean-field here represents the net effect of the entire building envelope on any individual zone. Rather than solving the large-scale centralized problem, we explore distributed game-theoretic solution approaches that work by optimizing with respect to the mean-field. The methodology is illustrated with a numerical example in a simulation environment."
