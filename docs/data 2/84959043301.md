## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 38 papers. The topics discussed include: a data-driven meta-data inference framework for building automation systems; analyzing metadata schemas for buildings - the good, the bad, and the ugly; multi-user energy consumption monitoring and anomaly detection with partial context information; from pressure to path: barometer-based vehicle tracking; water or slime? a platform for automating water treatment systems; energy efficiency gains in daily grass heating operation of sports facilities through supervisory holistic control; microgrid losses - when the whole is greater than the sum of its parts; intuitive appliance identification using image matching in smart buildings; controlling actuation in central HVAC systems in buildings; and MapSentinel: map-aided non-intrusive indoor tracking in sensor-rich environments."
