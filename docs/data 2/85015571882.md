## Abstract
"Heating ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are a costly energy source used in most facilities, but that energy cost is often overlooked or underestimated. An HVAC system is usually installed for human comfort, but can also have a major impact on the operation of the process equipment. The basic energy cost of an HVAC system includes not only the electrical cost of the fan and pump system but also the heating and cooling energy source costs to support the operational needs. This chapter focuses on a typical HVAC system used in a manufacturing facility, including the office areas, to condition the environment. Concentrating on the proper operation and maintenance of an HVAC system will ensure the highest operating efficiency and lowest energy cost. The chapter analyzes four functions of an HVAC that are important to energy efficiency: supply side with demand side alignment; operation; maintenance; and recommissioning."
