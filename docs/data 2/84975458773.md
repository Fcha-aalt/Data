## Abstract
"Demand response programs, reduced air conditioner size, and improved thermal integrity all reduce the peak demand for residential air conditioning. All can also affect the comfort of residential occupants. A simulation of six hundred houses provides insight into the peak reductions available from each, and their effects on occupant comfort. Reduced air conditioner size and improved thermal integrity should always be evaluated whenever a demand response program, distributed generation, or energy storage are considered."
