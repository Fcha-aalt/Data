## Abstract
"The aim of this paper is to examine the energy consumption of and determine energy-efficient design strategies for mid-rise and high-rise office buildings in composite climate. For this purpose, a comparative study is performed of six energy-efficient office buildings in composite climate in India. The selected energy-efficient office buildings are situated in the major cities (Delhi, Gurgaon, and Hyderabad) of India with a composite climate. This study investigates the effectiveness of different design strategies for reducing the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) and lighting loads of the six buildings. The effect of factors such as the building form, envelope configuration, placement of the service core, window-to-wall ratio (WWR), and percentage of air-conditioned space on the HVAC load are analyzed. Similarly, the effect of the plan depth and WWR on the lighting load is also determined. Finally, the findings of the study are used to recommend effective design strategies for high-rise office buildings in composite climate. Moreover, the energy performance data are compared with the national energy consumption benchmarks for composite climate. The comparison indicates the design strategies performed well, that lead to a decrease in the energy consumption of high-rise office buildings in composite climate."
