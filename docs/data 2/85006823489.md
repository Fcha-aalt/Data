## Abstract
"As per the emerging energy efficiency standards in various parts of the world, it is becoming imperative for all the manufacturers of HVAC systems to enhance their system efficiencies. Compressor is a major contributor to system's efficiency. Any improvement in compressor efficiency reflects positively & veritably in the system. Electrical induction motor being foremost part of compressor by means of watts consumed & heat produced, strong interest is shown to reduce the core losses at the design stage. Therefore, a rigorous analysis of the electromagnetic behavior is needed to fulfill such purpose. Considering competitive market and price of electrical steel, analysis has to be done while choosing correct grade of steel for motor. The paper discusses the fundamental factors that are involved in selection of electrical steel, parameters affecting the performance of induction motors and hermetic compressor. The objective of this study is to compare the effect of electrical steel on dynamometer efficiency and EER of hermetic compressor. For this various grades of electrical steels are tested for their magnetic properties by Epstein testing. Performance of the same is checked for motor efficiency and compressor EER. The comparative analysis is performed and it is intended to show the importance of data analysis for manufacturers guiding price negotiations, parameters for future projects and quality control data of electrical steel."
