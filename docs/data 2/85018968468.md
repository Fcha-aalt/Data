## Abstract
"Fresh Meadow Mechanical Corp. is ready for an epic project, managing all HVAC work at Columbia University's new Manhattanville Campus in upper Manhattan. The 17-acre expansion, estimated at over $6 billion, is the Ivy League university's largest in more than a century and will open in stages through 2030. The institute project has â€œhad many challenges including loading in the chillers, boilers, air-handling units and installing two 100-ft-tall freestanding boiler exhaust stacks on the roof of the building. Fresh Meadow has completed a number of large projects in the region, including work at 1 World Trade Center and 40 Wall Street in New York City, as well as at Canon Americas headquarters in Melville. In the energy conservation sector, Fresh Meadow recently completed a project for Mutual Redevelopment Houses, a cooperative residential complex on the West Side of Manhattan that involved replacing two hot water boilers with more energy efficient medium pressure steam high-efficiency boilers. Currently, Fresh Meadow is also doing renovations at Citigroup headquarters in lower Manhattan, including replacement of 30-year-old chiller plants in both of the financial services giant's buildings."
