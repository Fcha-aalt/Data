## Abstract
"The purpose of this Cooling device is to provide an energy efficient solution to cater for the ever increasing cooling requirements for IT and HVAC systems in the Data Centre and Telecoms sectors. The objective of this document is to discuss an energy rating standard for Printed Circuit Board component's which will lead to the Electronics Industry introducing an integral self cooling method of rejecting heat. The present reliance on a separate mechanical cooling system powered by conventional Fan and Compressor motors is clearly unsustainable and is in no uncertain terms passing the Carbon buck to the HVACR industry."
