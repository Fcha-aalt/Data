## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 11 papers. The special focus in this conference is on Energy optimization algorithms and models, the future role of data centres in Europe and energy efficiency metrics for data centres. The topics include: Agile traffic merging for DCNs; performance and energy efficiency of parallel processing in data center environments; cyclic blackout mitigation through HVAC shifted queue optimization; stochastic petri net models for the analysis of trade-offs in data centres with power management; enabling green data centres in smart cities; analysis of the influence of application deployment on energy consumption; minimization of costs and energy consumption in a data center by a workload-based capacity management; building application profiles to allow a better usage of the renewable energies in data centres; review on performance metrics for energy efficiency in data center: the role of thermal management and assessing data center infrastructure power adaptability."
