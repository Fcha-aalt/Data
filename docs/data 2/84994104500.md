## Abstract
"In recent years, the service life of Polymeric Insulators is the major part in the electrical field distribution. This paper illustrates electric field and potential distribution in composite insulators under dry conditions using charge simulation method. Electric field is calculated for 500KV both AC and DC line insulators using MATLAB and graphical representations are shown in this paper. In this paper, ring charges are used for calculating electric field and potential distribution in both insulators due to symmetrical characteristics of insulators and the results are obtained under dry condition."
