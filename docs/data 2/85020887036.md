## Abstract
"The energy resource problem is an important part of the development of society. For a long time, China's research on HVAC system mainly focuses on the development and application of energy-saving equipment and the innovation and development of energy-saving design, ignoring the key areas of energy-saving operation. The lack of operation and management of air conditioning system makes the energy saving mode of public air conditioning system difficult to play a full role. In this paper, the typical hot summer and warm winter area of the hotel building air conditioning system was selected as a case, the status of its operation was investigated and studied, the air conditioning system energy-saving operation model was understood, comparative analysis was carried out from the optimization point of view. The operational efficiency ratio (SOEER) was used to quantify the calculation. The advantages and disadvantages of the system were discussed. The further operation strategy was put forward. The measured analysis was carried out, which provides the reference for realizing the energy saving target and improving the system energy efficiency."
