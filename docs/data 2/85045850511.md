## Abstract
"In this paper, a sustainable approach to home automation system has been emphasized upon bearing in mind to optimize opportunities of energy saving and home security. Home automation systems serve as an addition to conventional construction, thereby ensuring consumption of energy in a synchronized method. It also leads to continuous monitoring of the home perimeter to ensure the highest level of safety of the residents. Apart from these, it ensures optimum indoor environment for maximum comfort. Home automation directly engages with the energy ingestion in installed lighting, HVAC system, perimeter security, etc. With technology proliferation, modern homes and buildings are progressively adopting technologies which would not only safeguard energy but would also sustain for a longer period."
