## Abstract
"This work addresses the energy performance of a solar Desiccant and Evaporative Cooling (DEC) system working with the freescoo technology. Freescoo is an innovative solar air conditioning concept for ventilation, cooling, dehumidification and heating of buildings in residential and tertiary sectors. The monitoring of the system started in November 2016 and will continue until the end of 2017. Energy performances are evaluated according to the monitoring procedure for solar cooling systems developed by the Task 38 and 48 of the International Energy Agency experts. The analysis based on monitoring data shows that, for typical operating conditions in cooling mode, the electricity saving in comparison to conventional HVAC systems can be over 70%."
