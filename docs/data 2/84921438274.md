## Abstract
"This paper presents energy and exergy assessments of a new integrated system with different psychrometric processes for HVAC&R applications. The mass, energy, entropy and exergy balance equations for all system components and processes are developed for analysis and performance assessment purposes. In addition, a novel integrated system with psychrometric processes is proposed and thermodynamically analysed. Both energy and exergy efficiencies for individual components, sub-processes and the integrated system under different conditions and capacities are defined and determined. Parametric studies are conducted by varying dead state properties and operating conditions to investigate their effects on the system performance. The results show that the energy and exergy efficiencies of the integrated system become 18.6% and 33.31% respectively."
