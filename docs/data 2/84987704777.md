## Abstract
"This paper offers a review of approaches to the automated creation of input data for building energy simulation. Such data may be obtained by translation of available data from architectural and HVAC models. However, a full energy performance model also requires missing data to be completed, either with default values or automated procedures. Following the review, research opportunities for further automation are identified."
