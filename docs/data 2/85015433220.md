## Abstract
"Buildings around the world account for a significant portion of energy consumption. Therefore, energy efficiency in buildings is of high importance. Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) accounts for the highest amount of energy consumption in the buildings. In this paper, FloVENTÂ® is used for simulation of room models in the different scenarios. The first experiment is done to find the effect of the ambient temperature changes. Another experiment is done to find the relationship between the airflow rate and the room temperature. This is useful for energy efficient HVAC operation, in particular for controlling the associated variable speed drive (VSD)."
