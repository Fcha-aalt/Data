## Abstract
"This paper investigates the indoor light environment, lighting energy consumption and total energy including annual HVAC system in temperate and temperate monsoon climate zones. In certain areas, annual temperature variation is very extreme therefore a high thermal insulating performance for glazing systems is required to minimize the effects of outdoor temperature changes on the indoor temperature. To obtain a variable solar heat gain coefficient value for annual energy performance, single and double skin façade systems were examined for this study and 18 cases considering blind type, ventilation and installing places were set to compare the effectiveness of each. Lighting energy consumption was also investigated using dimming control, high efficient lamp, and blind control throughout an entire year. With the calculation results from the target building as a baseline, we performed the calculation 992 times with a combination of energy saving measures, and total primary energy of lighting and HVAC ranging from 282kWh/m 2 year to 372kWh/m 2 year."
