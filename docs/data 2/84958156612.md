## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 55 papers. The topics discussed include: prioritising energy efficiency measures to achieve a zero net-energy hotel on the island of Gozo in the central Mediterranean; hybrid model predictive control of a residential HVAC system with PVT energy generation and PCM thermal storage; investigation of high renewable energy penetration in the island of Syros following the interconnection with the national grid system; did ARBED I save energy in Wales' deprived dwellings; testing building fabric performance and the impacts upon occupant safety, energy use and carbon inefficiencies in dwellings; towards a smart grid communication; sustainable design and building information modelling: case study of energy plus house, Hieron's Wood, Derbyshire UK; high energy efficiency retrofits in Portugal; cooling systems in data centers: state of art and emerging technologies; and performance analysis of roof-mounted photovoltaic systems - the case of a Norwegian residential building."
