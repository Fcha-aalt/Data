## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 61 papers. The special focus in this conference is on Engineering Applications of Neural Networks. The topics include: Motion-specialized deep convolutional descriptor for plant water stress estimation; analysis of parallel process in HVAC systems using deep autoencoders; using advanced audio generating techniques to model electrical energy load; memristor based chaotic neural network with application in nonlinear cryptosystem; predicting student performance in distance higher education using active learning; heuristics-based detection to improve text/graphics segmentation in complex engineering drawings; intrinsic plagiarism detection with feature-rich imbalanced dataset learning; random resampling in the one-versus-all strategy for handling multi-class problems; a spiking one-class anomaly detection framework for cyber-security on industrial control systems; boosted residual networks; a convolutional approach to multiword expression detection based on unsupervised distributed word representations and task-driven embedding of lexical features; remarks on tea leaves aroma recognition using deep neural network; deep convolutional neural networks for fire detection in images; improving face pose estimation using long-term temporal averaging for stochastic optimization; discriminatively trained autoencoders for fast and accurate face recognition; fish classification in context of noisy images; a method for the detection of the most suitable fuzzy implication for data applications; application of asymmetric networks to movement detection and generating independent subspaces; two hidden layers are usually better than one; neural networks as a learning component for designing board games and emotion prediction of sound events based on transfer learning."
