## Abstract
"Phase change materials (PCMs) have been introduced into building components such as gypsum board or plaster to cover room interior surfaces that interact with the HVAC system, but can also absorb internal heat gains and transmitted solar radiation. Thus, PCMs can play an important role as passive or active heat storage to reduce energy consumption and peak demand for cooling and heating by storing solar and other heat gains. PCMs can also maintain good thermal comfort by reducing room temperature fluctuations while storing and releasing heat gains during a day. To achieve wider adoption of PCMs in buildings, a number of essential key steps are discussed through two examples, including their integration into building energy design and the development of predictive control strategies to optimize their charge/discharge and reduce peak heating demand. First, a concept of active ventilated double facade with photovoltaics and PCM is overviewed, followed by active PCM walls/ceilings with ventilated PCM layers and active charging of the storage; the discharge can be passive or active."
