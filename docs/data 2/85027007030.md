## Abstract
"This paper develops and utilizes an optimization based framework to investigate the maximal energy efficiency potentially attainable by HVAC system operation in a non-predictive context. Performance is evaluated relative to the existing state of the art set-point reset strategies. The expected efficiency increase driven by operation constraints relaxations is evaluated."
