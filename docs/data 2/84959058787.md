## Abstract
"Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems are one of the biggest consumers of energy within commercial buildings, contributing to over 40% of their energy us- age. A large scale Building Management System (BMS) comprising of hundreds of sensors and actuators is commonly used to appropriately manage the HVAC operations in a facility. Such BMS require manual set points (e.g. time to switch on the chillers in the morning) which are often driven by some thumb rules. Further, large scale data generated by BMS is rarely analyzed to identify opportunities for operational savings. In this paper we take two specific use cases - 1. Optimal start time for HVAC for pre-cooling the buildings to desired temperature; and 2. Identifying excessive air-flow in the HVAC system using large scale BMS data leading to opportunities for energy savings. We use data from two buildings in India to demonstrate the effectiveness of using such simple analytics in identifying the energy saving potential from the HVAC system."
