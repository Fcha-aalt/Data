## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 103 papers. The topics discussed include: adaptive user-oriented direct load-control of residential flexible devices; want to reduce energy consumption, whom should we call?; adequate feedback-based customer incentives in automated demand response; how much demand side flexibility do we need? analyzing where to exploit flexibility in industrial processes; NowCasting: accurate and precise short-term wind power prediction using hyperlocal wind forecasts; how many smartphones does it take to detect a power outage?; towards the modeling of flexibility using artificial neural networks in energy management and smart grids; segmenting residential smart meter data for short-term load forecasting; intelligent agent strategies for residential customers in local electricity markets; utilizing device-level demand forecasting for flexibility markets; a capacity-price game for uncertain renewables resources; day-ahead trading of aggregated energy flexibility; robust and practical approaches for solar PV and storage sizing; analyzing distribution transformers at city scale and the impact of EVS and storage; scheduling fast local rule-based controllers for optimal operation of energy storage; distributed energy management of P2P energy sharing in energy internet based on cloud energy storage; vSolar: virtualizing community solar and storage for energy sharing; UniversalNILM: a semi-supervised energy disaggregation framework using general appliance models; EMBED: a dataset for energy monitoring through building electricity disaggregation; and data driven chiller sequencing for reducing HVAC electricity consumption in commercial buildings."
