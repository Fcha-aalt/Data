## Abstract
"This study presents the modelling and simulation of an airport terminal using EnergyPlus software considering the conditions currently faced by the terminal, the cooling demand attended to by chillers and an alternative situation in which a thermal energy storage (TES) tank is employed. The airport terminal was modelled considering real materials, occupation schedules and equipment usage coupled to the climatic file for the specific city where the airport is located. The electrical energy consumption and power demand were adjusted to match the energy and demand bills issued by the local electricity utility company. The air-conditioning system was modelled using performance data obtained from the manufacturers of the equipment. The electricity cost reduction was estimated in US$ 285,000.00 per year, mainly due to an electrical demand reduction of almost 24% at peak hours. The use of different operating strategies such as night operation allowed for a higher coefficient of performance (COP) to be achieved. Considering only the summer months, a general energy reduction of 5% was estimated for the HVAC system plant equipment. Another important benefit of TES is the possibility of increasing the airport's cooling capacity by approximately 25% through the simultaneous use of the HVAC system and cooling storage tank capacities."
