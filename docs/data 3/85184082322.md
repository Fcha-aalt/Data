## Abstract
"Data-driven HVAC energy consumption modeling could play an important role in operating energy-efficient buildings. However, (1) existing data-driven approaches rely on rigid sensor networks to collect indoor physical parameter data, often deployed in an ad-hoc manner or based on engineering judgment; and (2) the impact of this practice on model performance is often poorly understood. To address this gap, this paper aims to assess the impact of sensor deployment configurations on HVAC energy consumption modeling, where a configuration is defined in terms of the number and locations of sensors and their flexibility (i.e., fixed or can change over time). Indoor temperature and humidity data were collected from an office building. Several configurations were defined and evaluated in predicting the HVAC consumption, using an XGBoost-based model. The results showed that sensor configurations could significantly impact the performance of HVAC consumption modeling, and that periodic changes in sensor locations could improve the performance of traditional rigid methods. The findings from this work could help define improved sensor configurations for enhanced HVAC management and operation."
