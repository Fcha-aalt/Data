## Abstract
"Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems account for one-third of the total energy consumption in office buildings. The use of airflow measurements to control the operation of HVAC systems can reduce energy consumption; thus, a sensor capable of monitoring airflow in a duct system is critical. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) can be utilized as self-powered sensors in airflow-driven TENGs (ATENGs) as self-powered sensors. By employing ferroelectric materials and surface modifications, the surface charges of TENGs can be increased. In this study, fibrous-mat TENGs were prepared using ferroelectric materials consisting of poly (vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (PVDF-TrFE) and polyamide 11 (nylon-11). And these materials were subsequently investigated. Poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) was added to PVDF-TrFE to enhance the ferroelectric crystalline phase. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that this incorporation affects the Î² phase. In addition, the surface of nylon-11 was modified using the electrospray technique for post-treatment, thereby improving the interfacial adhesion between the fibers. These materials were then utilized in fibrous-mat ATENGs (FM-ATENGs) to demonstrate their practical application. The FM-ATENGs can be effectively used in an Arduino airflow-check sensor, showcasing their potential for application in HVAC systems, to enhance airflow control and energy efficiency.
