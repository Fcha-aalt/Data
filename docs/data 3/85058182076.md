## Abstract
"Promise of achieving building energy efficiency is seen in incorporating dynamic HVAC scheduling algorithm which requires occupancy prediction. Previously, predictive accuracy has always been the major focus of most work when comparing different occupancy prediction methods. However, as the main objective of HVAC control is to maintain a satisfactory indoor environment with the minimum energy consumption, it is essential to evaluate occupancy prediction methods in the context of demonstrating energy savings and thermal comfort behaviors. Therefore, three occupancy prediction methods - ARIMA, support vector regression, and linear regression - were compared on the three metrics of accuracy, energy savings, and thermal comfort. It was found that ARIMA outperformed the other two methods by around 36% in the light of accuracy, whilst the relative simulative differences shrunk to no more than 17% when the occupancy predictions of different methods were input into EnergyPlus to simulate the energy savings and thermal comfort behaviors, and likeness in prediction results did not correlate to similar simulative performances. Therefore, accuracy is not suggested to be seen as the upmost prerequisite when deciding the method of occupancy prediction for HVAC control; sensitivity studies of factors like simplicity and reliability may be conducted for comparing different occupancy prediction methods."
