## Abstract
"Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems are the important component of building energy consumption (EnC), especially in the severe cold area. Enhancing heat storage capacity and solar energy efficiency are common effective measures to save energy of the buildings. Considering the low thermal conductivity of aerogel and the excellent heat storage ability of PCM (phase-change material), a sunspace for rural residential buildings using PCM walls and silica aerogel glass (PCMS-silica) to reduce indoor temperature fluctuations in cold regions was proposed. The building EnC and the temperature of PCMS-silica were compared with the existing reference sunspace (RS) and PCM wall sunspace (PCMS). Additionally, the influences of different thickness of silica aerogel layer on building EnC and indoor thermal environment (ITE) were studied. The conclusion indicates that the heating EnC of the utilization of PCMS and PCMS-silica is reduced by 10 % and 14 % respectively, compared with RS. It is concluded that 9 mm thickness of silica aerogel layer is recommended with regard to the minimal energy saving rate and maximum average indoor temperature."
