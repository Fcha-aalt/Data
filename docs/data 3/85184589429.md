## Abstract
"The total energy usage of the domestic sector accounts for 35.3% of total global energy consumption of this percentage, 50% is used for room and domestic HVAC systems. We worked for designing a standard module to achieve the maximum temperature difference. In this paper Diurnal Temperature Variation phenomena has been studied. The standard Simulationof the HVAC system using Diurnal Temperature Variation has been performed. The current work is a scale down model of Ground Source Heat Pump which is totally renewable in nature. This scale down model works on Diurnal temperature variation. Diurnal temperature fluctuation is the temperature difference obtained during the daytime and night time with higher and lower soil temperature. Same phenomenon is used to obtain a cooling effect and heating effect as we go deeper inside the Earth. The current work is complete replica of Ground source heat pump where the application of this phenomenon is used. Air as a flowing media is used for heat transfer between soil. The air is meant to be flown through the capillary tubes and at certain depth we get a coolingor heating effect according to atmospheric conditions. Along with that we do have to care aboutthe human leisure requirements, for the very purpose we are also passing some amount of freshair along with reusing the cool air inside the room by flowing it through the walls of room to provide insulation against the infiltrating heat and other elements that add temperature inside theroom. It has been identified the 10.40% reduction in atmospheric air and hence it can be concluded that the geothermal HVAC system can be a sustainable and energy efficient alternative to traditional HVAC system. Also identified that the geothermal HVAC systems offer a promising solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing energy efficiency in the building sector."
