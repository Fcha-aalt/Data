## Abstract
"This article addresses event-triggered optimal load dispatching based on collaborative neurodynamic optimization. Two cardinality-constrained global optimization problems are formulated and two event-triggering functions are defined for event-triggered load dispatching in thermal energy and electric power systems. An event-triggered dispatching method is developed in the collaborative neurodynamic optimization framework with multiple projection neural networks and a meta-heuristic updating rule. Experimental results are elaborated to demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of the approach against many existing methods for optimal load dispatching in air conditioning systems and electric power generation systems."
