## Abstract
"Thermal comfort of occupants in conventional vehicles driven by an internal combustion engine is controlled by heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. However, the operation of a conventional HVAC system decreases the mileage of electric vehicle (EV) in the heating mode by nearly 50%. Thus, local radiant heating was proposed as a heating strategy to reduce electric energy consumption while providing reasonable thermal comfort. In this work, we developed a personalized overall thermal sensation (OS) model using machine learning to evaluate the thermopsychological effect of local radiant heating and simulate the OS of occupants in EVs. Data were obtained from a real EV that went through a cold environmental chamber and were evaluated using random forest algorithm. By considering individual thermal preferences of occupants, we predicted the OS for each subject with higher accuracy by a factor of 2.6 compared with the prediction performed using the weighted average method. Total energy consumption was reduced by approximately 10% in the EV equipped with local infrared radiant warmers while providing OS that was comparable with that of the HVAC system."
