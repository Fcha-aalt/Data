## Abstract
"Data centers (DCs) are becoming increasingly important. Accordingly, highly efficient and reliable operation and management of DCs have bee Conventional DCs operate information and communication technology (ICT) and facility management (FM) systems separately, which co inefficient management. Nowadays, DCs have been focusing on the data center infrastructure management (DCIM) system, in which ICT equip power equipment, and other heating ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) devices can be managed in an integrated manner. In this paper, we propose a method of designing rack and ICT placement as an example of initiatives that reau\e proper temperature management and energy sav using DCIM and machine learning (ML). Then models for predicting the temperature energy after enviroment chages by using machine learning developed, and the results of verification and effectiveness in the verification room are reported."
