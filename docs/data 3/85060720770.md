## Abstract
"With the ever-increasing complexity in commercial building heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) and building automation systems, there are often gaps between a building's potential level of energy efficiency and the actual operation. A vast amount of data is now available to analyze equipment operation and identify these gaps. Fortunately, analytical software tools can turn the flood of building data into actionable information. These software tools add great benefit to building operation with the ability to visualize data and automatically detect operational issues. Utilizing these tools also brings challenges that should be considered, from making the initial data connection to addressing the increased quantity of issues uncovered."
