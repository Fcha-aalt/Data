## Abstract
"Indoor environmental parameters are closely related to the energy consumption and indoor thermal comfort of office buildings. Predicting these parameters, especially indoor temperature, can contribute to the management of energy consumption and thermal comfort levels in office buildings. An accurate indoor temperature prediction model is the basis for implementing this process. To this end, this paper first discusses the input and output parameters of the model, and then it compares the prediction effects of mainstream prediction model algorithms based on data mining under the same data conditions. The superiority of the XGBoost integrated learning algorithm is verified, and a further XGBoost-based indoor temperature online prediction method is designed. The effectiveness of the method is validated using actual data from a commercial office building in Haidian District, Beijing. Finally, optimization methods for the prediction method are discussed with regard to the scheduler mechanism proposed in this paper. Overall, this work can assist building operators in optimizing HVAC equipment running strategies, thus improving the indoor thermal comfort and energy efficiency of the building."
