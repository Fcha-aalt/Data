## Abstract
"An increasingly globalized market has introduced new challenges for automotive industries. Customers are demanding a broader range and selection of products, requiring businesses to innovate and rapidly deliver on market demands. At the same time, product complexity has escalated as organizations increasingly adopt technology-based innovation to satisfy the increasing demand of high performance, energy efficient and enhanced comfort. A Systems Engineering approach addresses product development challenges throughout the product lifecycle for each system design and development. It maximizes customer value, by improving the function, quality, reliability and time to market for a new vehicle. This paper will describe the characteristics and aspects of Systems Engineering methodology and automotive HVAC design process and target setting for each function using system engineering approach."
