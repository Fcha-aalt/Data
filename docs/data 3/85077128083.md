## Abstract
"An important role in the consumption of electric energy in urban transport are non-traction needs (auxiliaries), the main part of which is heating and air condition (HVAC). Auxiliaries are responsible for almost half of total energy consumption (normal weather conditions) and in the winter (or hot summer) it reaches up to 70% in daily scale. The reduction of energy used for non-traction needs is currently the main challenge related to the reduction of energy demand of means of transport. It is particularly important for battery vehicles, powered from an energy source with a very limited capacity. The article presents the analysis of the influence of air temperature on the energy consumption of electric traction carried out on the basis of the real data measurement analysis. The relation between the ambient temperature and the demand for heating power was determined quantitatively. The impact of traffic delays on auxiliaries energy consumption was analyzed and it was shown, that traffic congestion can result in 60% overall energy consumption increase. Presented researches also refer to the relationship between the bus charging cycle (night charging, opportunity fast charging) and the optimal value of energy consumption, which should be assumed for energy calculations. Depending on the charging mode, the differences can reach up to 50%. In the final part of the article, different methods of optimization of non-traction needs systems were compared."
