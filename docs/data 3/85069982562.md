## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 156 papers. The special focus in this conference is on Human Interaction and Emerging Technologies. The topics include: Effect of vibration exercise in the modified push-up position on hand neural efficiency in rheumatoid arthritis: Preliminary results; effects of whole-body vibration in cardiorespiratory and hormonal parameters in elderly people: Preliminary results; effects of whole-body vibration exercises on the body fat distribution of the metabolic syndrome individuals: Preliminary outcomes; effects of passive whole-body vibration and auriculotherapy on the surface electromyographic pattern of the vastus lateralis right muscle in individuals with knee osteoarthritis; digital citizenship behavior in organization as indicator for actorsâ€™ co-creative problem-solving in ecosystem-oriented work environments; assessing trends of digital divide within digital services in New York city; deep water: Predicting water meter failures through a human-machine intelligence collaboration; distributed connectivity-preserving coordination of multi-agent systems with bounded velocities; society 5.0 as a result of the technological evolution: Historical approach; concepts for improving employee qualifications for resource-efficient chipping production; Using machine learning to optimize energy consumption of HVAC systems in vehicles; an evolutionary approach to hyper-parameter optimization of neural networks; universal basic income: Comparative analysis of experiments; user discrimination of content produced by generative adversarial networks; application of a human factors-integrated information security framework to an oil and gas organization; development of a stripper machine for Al-Mabsili dates and evaluation of human interactions and performances; towards educational technologies in language learning for children: A perspective of linguistic anthropology; human-in-the-Middle: Increasing security of two-factor authentication; assessment and design of employees-cobot-interaction."
