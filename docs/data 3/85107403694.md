## Abstract
"This paper summarizes recent work to develop new airside heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment model analytical verification test cases for ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 140, Standard Method of Test for the Evaluation of Building Energy Analysis Computer Programs. The analytical verification test method allows comparison of simulation results from a wide variety of building energy simulation programs with quasi-analytical solutions. Standard 140 is widely cited for evaluating software for use with performance-path energy efficiency analysis in conjunction with well-known energy-efficiency standards, including ASHRAE Standard 90.1, the International Energy Conservation Code, and other international standards. Airside HVAC equipment is a common area of modelling not previously explicitly tested by Standard 140. Integration of the completed test suite into Standard 140 is in progress."
