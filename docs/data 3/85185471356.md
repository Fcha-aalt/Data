## Abstract
"Energy consumed by HVAC (heating, ventilating and air conditioning) systems represents a considerable part of the energy consumed in buildings. This paper focuses on achieving energy efficiency, through automatic control strategies, of HVAC systems in the biopharmaceutical industry, a sector little covered by previous studies, mainly focused on residential and commercial buildings. The system under study is an air handling unit (AHU). The main contributions of this research are the obtaining of a dynamic, multivariable, and non-linear model of the AHU, proposing a relatively simple structure and the procedure to estimate its parameters; a non-linear static model of the power consumption of its bank of electrical resistors, also simple, but useful to guide the PID tuning toward energy efficiency; and the approximation to the model of a PID controller whose control low is unknown. The methods proposed to obtain the models and to perform the simulations are also provided. Results for a close-to-reality simulation scenario that suggests the possibility of reducing the power consumed by the resistor bank by 29 % are presented. The use of an industrial PI control algorithm, instead of the classical textbook algorithm, also distinguishes this work from others."
