## Abstract
"It has been found in recent years that using setpoint temperatures based on adaptive thermal comfort models is a successful method of energy conservation. Recent studies using adaptive setpoint temperatures incorporate international models from ASHRAE Standard 55 and EN16798-1. This study, however, has instead considered a regional Brazilian adaptive comfort model. This study investigates the energy demand arising from the use of a local Brazilian comfort model in order to assess the energy implications from the use of the worldwide ASHRAE Standard 55 adaptive model and various fixed setpoint temperatures. All of Brazil’s climate zones, full air-conditioning, mixed-mode building operating modes, present-day climate change scenarios, and future scenarios—specifically Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 for the years 2050 and 2100—have all been taken into account in building energy simulations. The use of adaptive setpoint temperatures based on the Brazilian local model considering mixed-mode has been found to significantly reduce energy consumption when compared to static setpoint temperatures (average energy-saving values ranging from 52% to 58%) and the ASHRAE 55 adaptive model (average values ranging from 15% to 21%). Considering climate change and the mixed-mode Brazilian model, the overall energy demand for the three groups of climatic zones (annual average outdoor temperatures ≤ 21 °C, > 21 and ≤ 25 °C and > 25 °C) ranged between 2% decrease and 5% increase, 4% and 27% increase, and 13% and 45% increase, respectively. It is concluded as a consequence that setting setpoint temperatures based on the Brazilian local adaptive comfort model is a very efficient energy-saving method."
