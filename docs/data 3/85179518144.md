## Abstract
"Non-Intrusive Thermal Load Monitoring (NITLM) is a promising technique that disaggregates the total thermal load in a room into past and present sub-loads. In addition, we can realize more effective HVAC system management by observing future sub-loads. This paper proposes Non-Intrusive Thermal Load Disaggregation and Forecasting (NITLDF) for HVAC systems that forecast future sub-loads based on the past and present total thermal load. Experimental results show that compared to two-step approaches that perform disaggregation and forecasting in turn, an integrated approach that simultaneously reduces the error between forecasted and ground truth by 28. 8%, the size of the model by 57. 1%, and the execution time by 58.8%."
