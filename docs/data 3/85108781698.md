## Abstract
"Around the world, global warming and energy consumption in the building had become the most important reasons to have directed the worldâ€™s attention to energy-efficient building. Building sectors have increased parallel with the urbanization expansion in the developed countries, which increases the energy demand use in the building. External parameters and internal building components have a significant impact on the enhanced energy performance of the building. The use of energy assessment tools along with building information modeling could provide an effective contribution to support decision-making in the early design stages. This will enable a selection for proper building components and materials as well as minimize the influence on the overall energy consumption of buildings. This case study examines an education building located in the city of Alexandria (Egypt). The examine include life cycle electricity, fuel use, and life cycle energy cost along with the annual energy use intensity and annual peak demand considering four-building parameters (Orientation, Wall, Roof, HVAC) have been evaluated and compared with the initial design. This work enables stakeholders to have a previous virtual imagination to whole building components and to measure the total and annual energy need for each component, thereby driving to achieve near-zero-energy building as well as better cost-savings of building life cycle."
