## Abstract
"One of the priorities in detecting a faulty car engine is through a method known as diagnostic, and it is very crucial as each diagnostic able to provide information and assessment to identify problems in the car A/C compressor. Early detection of a compressor malfunction, is a fast way to prevent any heavy maintenance of vehicles either in the short or long term. This paper introduced a new statistical method to find the faulty in the vehicle's A/C compressor which is known as Z-freq 2D. The foundation of Z-freq 2D is involving the implementation of a Z-notch frequency domain filter. This approach was enhanced by using a special sensor that can detect two axial axes known as the Phantom Vibration Sensor specifically designed to detect and monitor the performance of the A/C compressor of the vehicle. Using the sensor, the data were recorded at numerous parameter sets of compressor speed. The analyzed data shows that Z-freq 2D coefficient is increase as the speed of the compressor increase over the duration of time. Z-freq 2D can be used to detect the malfunction and the irregularities of vibration signals, which may be indicated that the compressor is failing."
