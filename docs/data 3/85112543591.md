## Abstract
"The building sector has an important factor in contributing to CO2 emission causes of global warming. The previous study showed that Heating, Ventilation and Air conditioning (HVAC) is the most dominant factor in building energy use. Reducing the heating or cooling load of buildings is the key for energy efficient building. The principle of hybrid ventilation is combining two different ventilation systems to reach thermal comfort, IAQ and reduce energy consumption. This paper review a hybrid ventilation (HV) system that applied on different location that refer to different climates. This paper conducted through literature review and brief discussion on system applied, the result and the background climate. The result show, based on the climate, there's a different hybrid ventilation system applied due to their effectiveness. In this study, in the temperate climates the HV can save energy up to 60-70%, hot arid 50% and warm humid 28%."
