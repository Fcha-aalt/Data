## Abstract
"Artificial intelligence technologies such as computer vision (CV), machine learning, Internet of Things (IoT), and robotics have advanced rapidly in recent years. The new technologies provide non-contact measurements in three areas: indoor environmental monitoring, outdoor environ-mental monitoring, and equipment monitoring. This paper summarizes the specific applications of non-contact measurement based on infrared images and visible images in the areas of personnel skin temperature, position posture, the urban physical environment, building construction safety, and equipment operation status. At the same time, the challenges and opportunities associated with the application of CV technology are anticipated."
