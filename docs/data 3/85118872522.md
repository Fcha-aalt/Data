## Abstract
"Nowadays the proper use of energy towards ever major energy efficiency is a topical issue also for heritage buildings (hereinafter HB) which have special value both as a material testimony of our past and as a cultural asset. Greater open-mindedness to find compatible integrated solutions to improve the sustainable use of our built heritage is growing which consider, not only revamping the structural integrity, the indoor air quality and user comfort, even appraise benefits on using innovative materials or construction techniques to increase energy efficiency and exploit renewable and solar energies. Technological advances in Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV), hybrid photovoltaic thermal systems in combination with other renewable resources can be used as support for other smart measures applied to the historic building envelop, windows or the HVAC and ventilation systems. Main findings based on documented examples of best practices clearly demonstrate the maturity of these solutions and will be presented. This study in Switzerland in the framework of two Interreg projects allowed to collect documentation on case-studies with a high standard energy concept, from net zero energy (NZEB) to positive energy buildings (PEB), which demonstrate how solar BIPV technologies can be well-integrated to enhance energy efficiency in historic buildings."
