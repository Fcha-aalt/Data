## Abstract
"Occupants require satisfactory indoor environment in buildings which are generally controlled with Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. However, current HVAC systems are designed to operate with conservative Set-Point (SP) temperature control based on generalized recommendations by the standards, which shows poor performance in terms of satisfying the occupants' comfort requirements in shared indoor spaces. An alternative method to ensure personal thermal comfort is to adjust the SP temperature of the space based on a learning method that collects individual feedback from occupants. In this study, the performance of an optimized HVAC SP temperature approach in a shared office was investigated which tested the threshold of comfort of occupants combined with the objective of saving energy required to cool the space. Experiments were conducted over six months in an air-conditioned office space in Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, which involved live control of office supply air temperature based on feedback of thermal comfort received from individual thermal sensing vote devices distributed to occupants in the office space. It was revealed that although the occupants are accustomed to colder indoor temperatures, an increase in SP temperatures did not compromise on the thermal comfort among occupants. The study shows that such control models can be used to deal with the trade-off between energy savings and thermal comfort. It also indicates that implementing HVAC SP temperature selection requires initial feedback from occupants but after learning about the occupants' tolerance limits, the need for votes in order to determine the SPs from occupants diminishes."
