## Abstract
"This paper introduces an improved real-time Model Predictive Climate Control (MPCC) technique to reduce power consumption in Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system of the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). In the presented control technique, the fan, heating and cooling power usage is optimized considering the effect of the ambient temperature. Moreover, the need of a physical temperature measurement sensor is eliminated using an ambient temperature observer. In a typical BEV, the HVAC load is significant and it influences the overall vehicle performance and driving range. Therefore, a real-time control system capable of maintaining desired cabin temperature while achieving maximum HVAC efficiency is highly desirable. In the proposed MPCC, the optimum split of the battery power between the heating\cooling and the fan power is identified as a function of ambient temperature through an offline optimization process and used in the form of a lookup-table for real-time implementation. It is demonstrated that the proposed MPCC improves energy consumption efficiency of the entire HVAC system up to 5% by dynamically adapting to the variations in the ambient temperature. Furthermore, owing to the online temperature observation process, the proposed HVAC control system allows elimination of ambient temperature sensor and corresponding maintenance efforts. In this paper, the performance of the proposed MPCC is evaluated over a single-zone HVAC model of a BEV in MATLAB\SimulinkÂ® environment."
