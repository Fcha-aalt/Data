## Abstract
"Strict energy targets are driving demands for greener and more sustainable energy generation, distribution and consumption practices. A significant portion of energy consumption is due to the use of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems within building. Optimising HVAC systems for energy efficiency requires improved environmental monitoring; as such more sensors are necessary for monitoring the indoor space. However, use of multiple sensors could be cost prohibitive, hence the need for low-cost sensor network systems. This paper presents a low-cost monitoring system and the testing of the system on humidity conditions, which is an important parameter affecting thermal comfort conditions in the indoor environment and by extension, energy consumption and/ or conservation. We argue that appropriately monitoring and reporting on indoor environment conditions helps to ensure appropriate application of control measures leading to efficient energy management and delivery. The system, with some modification and further development can also be used to monitor and control Mini/Microgrid systems or in other fields."
