## Abstract
"With the rapid development of modern society, the important parameters of comfort air conditioning measurement technology testing and intelligent requirements are becoming higher and higher. When the HVAC parameters are tested and controlled, the number of various test components used is large. When the test components fail or the measurement error is distorted, the comfort air conditioner cannot operate automatically. At the same time, some of the measured parameters cannot be acquired directly by the test element. In order to solve this kind of problem, in recent years, air conditioning researchers have put their research direction into soft measurement technology, which has made a qualitative leap in the testing and intelligence of comfort air conditioning parameters. This paper studies the application of soft sensor technology in comfort air conditioning test from reality."
