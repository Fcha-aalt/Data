## Abstract
"SDG 7 “affordable and clean energy” aims at expanding infrastructure and upgrading technology to provide clean and more efficient energy in all countries, encouraging socioeconomic growth and helping the environment. Its implementation through legislative instruments led to the writing of the Sapienza Energy Plan and the Energy Implementation Program, which define a series of medium-term implementation strategies on buildings inside and outside the Sapienza University campus. Strategies aimed at the energy redevelopment of the building envelope to achieve the minimization of energy needs and the construction of PV systems as well as the technical and regulatory adaptation of existing HVAC systems to improve the environmental comfort conditions. By the requirements of current legislation, the Energy Performance has been quantified through the energy efficiency analysis of the building in its current state and post-interventions, led using a simulation on an energy diagnostic software. After the analyses, the refurbishment interventions have allowed defining the guidelines, in compliance with the contents of the Guidelines for the energy efficiency of cultural heritage and the PES, through a series of strategies aimed at the conservation and improvement of the building envelope and at improving the energy efficiency and the IEQ of the School of Mathematics."
