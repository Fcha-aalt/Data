## Abstract
"With the advent of the Internet of Things, we can connect almost any device with each other and share information easily. This data can be further used in estimation, predictions, quantification, and molded into useful information for the synthesis of better responsive devices which we in modern terms quote as “Smart”. Buildings which are forefront of any economy setup are also influenced by this innovative idea and it is capable of integrating its traditional chores with a revamped appearance. However, this transition demands feasible and pragmatic solutions which not only aim at bringing the required change, but also frame the structure to accustom the work in technology for instrumental and worthwhile service. In this chapter, we scrutinize the various architectures and frameworks currently involved with the smart building approach and also examine their utility, outcomes, and prospects."
