The topics include: Citizen Data and Citizen Science: A Challenge for Official Statistics; detecting States of Distress in Financial Markets: The Case of the Italian Sovereign Debt; forecasting Combination of Hierarchical Time Series: A Novel Method with an Application to CoVid-19; frequency Domain Clustering: An Application to Time Series with Time-Varying Parameters; Heterogeneous Income Dynamics: Unemployment Consequences in Germany and the US; how Much Do Knowledge About and Attitude Toward Mobile Phone Use Affect Behavior While Driving? An Empirical Study Using a Structural Equation Model; impact of Emergency Online Classes on Studentsâ€™ Motivation and Engagement in University During the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Study Case; local Heterogeneities in Population Growth and Decline. A Spatial Analysis of Italian Municipalities; a Dynamic Power Prior for Bayesian Non-inferiority Trials; model Predictivity Assessment: Incremental Test-Set Selection and Accuracy Evaluation; Multiple Measures Realized GARCH Models; Multiversal Methods in Observational Studies: The Case of COVID-19; Neural Network for the Statistical Process Control of HVAC Systems in Passenger Rail Vehicles; on the Use of the Matrix-Variate Tail-Inflated Normal Distribution for Parsimonious Mixture Modeling; population Size Estimation by Repeated Identifications of Units. A Bayesian Semi-parametric Mixture Model Approach; spatial Interdependence of Mycorrhizal Nuclear Size in Confocal Microscopy; spatially Balanced Indirect Sampling to Estimate the Coverage of the Agricultural Census; the Assessment of Environmental and Income Inequalities; the Italian Social Mood on Economy Index During the Covid-19 Crisis; a Graphical Approach for the Selection of the Number of Clusters in the Spectral Clustering Algorithm; the Rating of Journals and the Research Outcomes in Statistical Sciences in Italian Universities; preface."
