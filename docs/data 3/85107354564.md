## Abstract
"This paper presents the author's experience from courses that focused on the design and analysis of a complex HVAC system of a school building in compliance with National Energy Code of Canada for Buildings (NECB). The courses are designed to achieve the following teaching objectives: (i) exploration and application of NECB for the preliminary design, (ii) learning and usage of the eQuest energy analysis program, (iii) estimation of the whole building energy performance, along with the indices of performance of HVAC equipment, and (iv) learning from mistakes in the input data and HVAC system description. The students' results presented a large dispersion around the average values due to errors and misinterpretations. If only the annual whole building energy performance is analyzed, some input errors are not discovered. Other results directly extracted or calculated from the simulation results should be compared with codes requirements and indices from publications and consulting firms."
