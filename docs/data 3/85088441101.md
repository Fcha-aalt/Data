## Abstract
"This chapter investigates cyber-physical system (CPS) design for enhancing energy efficiency of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems in a building consisting of multiple zones. We first present a thermodynamics model, called resistance-capacitance circuit model, where the inter-zone heat transfer is identified with current flow on an electrical circuit. We then formulate a set point optimization problem to balance the human comfort and energy saving while satisfying several constraints. We then design a CPS which integrates optimization dynamics based on primal-dual gradient dynamics and the physical dynamics with a local controller. The resulting CPS is then shown to be interpreted as an interconnection of passive systems. Accordingly, convergence of the room temperatures to the optimal solution and input-output stability are rigorously proved based on the passivity paradigm. The present framework is further extended to a scenario of co-optimizing energy management in multiple connected buildings. The present CPS is finally demonstrated on a simulator developed by combining a variety of software."
