## Abstract
"Aiming at the energy-saving control problem of Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) control method based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) is proposed. The optimization capability of DDPG is improved by collecting sensor data inside the HVAC system and using Autoencoder (AE) for feature extraction. DDPG improves the system Coefficient of Performance (system COP) by controlling the mass flow of the chilled water pump of the HVAC system. This method is simulated, trained and verified on the refined HVAC system model built in this paper. The experimental results show that the method proposed can effectively improve the system COP and achieve the goal of saving energy in the HVAC system."
