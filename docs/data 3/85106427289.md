## Abstract
"The rate of development growth in Indonesia has resulted in an increase of energy demand. In addition, most power generation systems still use fossil fuels of nearly 50%, in other words this fuel can run out within the next 18 years. The electricity needs in the building come from the use of lighting, computers, office equipment, heating, ventilation, air conditioning and also air conditioning systems (AHU). This paper aims to investigate energy efficiency based on cooling load capacity to reduce energy use and design an air conditioning system. A well-designed HVAC system will have a great impact on indoor air conditions. Room comfortability will be realized throughout the year and also the outside environment if cared for properly according to the procedures of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Handbook of Fundamentals. Mastek Mosque required 167,151,241 Btu/h. The ducting design for central air conditioning systems uses 12 x 8 pipes for the main ducting and 10 x 6 for the ducting suction with 12 nozzles and 10 x 6 and 10 x 8 return ducting sizes. This system has the advantages of efficient, silent cooling and increased comfort for prayer."
