## Abstract
"The energy consumption of buildings is a significant contributor to overall energy consumption in developed countries. Therefore, there is great demand for intelligent buildings in which energy consumption is optimized. Online control is a crucial aspect of such optimization. The implementation of modern algorithms that take advantage of developments in information technology, artificial intelligence, machine learning, sensors, and the Internet of Things (IoT) is used in this context. In this paper, an architecture for testing central heating control algorithms as well as the control algorithms of the heating system of the building is presented. In particular, evaluation metrics, the method for seamless integration, and the mechanism for real-time performance monitoring and control are put forward. The proposed tools have been successfully tested in a residential building, and the conducted tests confirmed the efficiency of the proposed solution."
