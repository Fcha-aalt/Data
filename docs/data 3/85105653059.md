## Abstract
"This study monitored CO2 and other parameters and evaluated ventilation and comfort conditions in 104 classrooms from 11 schools that had recent HVAC retrofits for energy efficiency. The mean and median CO2 concentrations were 895 ppm and 897 ppm. The ventilation rate (VR) was estimated for each day using the highest 15-min average CO2 concentration. Mean and median VRs across classrooms were 5.2 l/s-person and 4.8 l/s-person. The indoor thermal comfort was within the ASHRAE comfort zone for over 80% of the monitored time in 67 out of 104 classrooms; five classrooms were under-heated. Compared to prior US studies, the retrofitted classrooms had lower CO2 concentrations and higher VRs. However, several issues were still identified in the recent retrofitted ventilation systems."
