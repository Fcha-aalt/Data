## Abstract
"Energy-efficient buildings have attracted vast attention as a key component of sustainable development. Thermal load analysis is a pivotal step for the proper design of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems for increasing thermal comfort in energy-efficient buildings. In this work, novel a methodology is proposed to predict the cooling load (LC) of residential buildings based on their geometrical characteristics. Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network was coupled with metaheuristic algorithms to attain its optimum hyperparameter values. According to the results, the LC pattern can be promisingly captured and predicted by all developed hybrid models. Nevertheless, the comparison analysis revealed that the electrostatic discharge algorithm (ESDA) achieved the most powerful MLP model. Hence, utilizing the proposed methodology would give new insights into the thermal load analysis method and bridge the existing gap between the most recently developed computational intelligence techniques and energy performance analysis in the sustainable design of energy-efficient residential buildings."
