## Abstract
"This article presents a numerical and experimental campaign for the measurements and prediction of the sound pressure levels inside an office space. The measurements were realized in multiple points and the analysis was realized for all frequency range (31 Hz to 8 kHz). The main source of noise was found to be the HVAC system and improvements to it were needed. A complex 3D model was created for simulation purposes and to test several noise proof solutions. The initial simulations were first validated with the experimental data and afterwards a soundproof solution was simulated. This study shows how a complex indoor space geometry can be simulated and validated with experimental data."
