## Abstract
"This paper demonstrated the HVAC energy consumption simulations of the mechanically ventilated bedroom in a typical residential building. The results indicated that Heating Recovery Ventilators (HRV) were much more energy efficient than Energy Recovery Ventilators (ERV) since the latent load played a major part in the cooling load of mechanical ventilation under summer condition. In addition, analysis on the applicability of HRV or ERV of the typical apartment in various climate regions of China was carried out. Results showed heat recovery system was applicable in cold zones and extremely cold zones, and the energy saving rates of these areas with ERV were basically over 10% at the ventilation rate of 52 m3/h. Besides, it was not appropriate to equip ventilators with heat exchanger in summer hot winter cold zones without proper bypass control strategy, which was determined by coefficient of performance of HRV or ERV."
