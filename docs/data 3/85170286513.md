## Abstract
"This paper presents the development of a system that uses fuzzy logic in order to evaluate the thermal comfort conditions expressed by means of a score by the occupants of an office room The inputs of the system are represented by three datasets relevant to the study: the air temperature, the positioning of the occupant and the level of activity carried out by the occupant. Based on the comfort score obtained, the HVAC system located at the room level will maintain a comfortable environment. The proposed solution also contributes to the minimization of energy consumption in buildings. In order to collect the data sets necessary for the study, we used the SensorTile.box module as a wearable device."
