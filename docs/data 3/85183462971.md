## Abstract
"This study provides a detailed analysis of insulation materials’ impact on energy efficiency and environmental sustainability in a multifamily building. It extends its findings to anticipate future challenges in 2050, offering practical insights for building performance and climate adaptation. Key findings include the influence of changing external temperatures on heating and cooling energy needs. The study identifies mineral wool as the optimal choice for heating and expanded polystyrene for cooling ιn accordance with the highest standards, the best insulation is to be selected. Importantly, the research highlights the need to select insulation materials that align with evolving climate conditions and emphasizes the importance of adapting buildings and HVAC systems to reduce energy consumption. Furthermore, the study underscores the multifamily building's commitment to reducing carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions, demonstrating its dedication to sustainable practices. In summary, this analysis provides a scientifically grounded roadmap for architects, engineers, and policymakers to enhance energy efficiency and environmental sustainability in building design, insulation material selection, and climate adaptation."
