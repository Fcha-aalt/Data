## Abstract
"The heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) system consumes nearly 50% of the buildingâ€™s energy, especially in Taiwan with a hot and humid climate. Due to the challenges in obtaining energy sources and the negative impacts of excessive energy use on the environment, it is essential to employ an energy-efficient HVAC system. This study conducted the machine tools building in a university. The field measurement was carried out, and the data were used to conduct energy modelling with EnergyPlus (EP) in order to discover some improvements in energy-efficient design. The validation between field measurement and energy modelling was performed, and the error rate was less than 10%. The following strategies were proposed in this study based on several energy-efficient approaches, including room temperature settings, chilled water supply temperature settings, chiller coefficient of performance (COP), shading, and building location. Energy-efficient approaches have been evaluated and could reduce energy consumption annually. The results reveal that the proposed energy-efficient approaches of room temperature settings (3.8%), chilled water supply temperature settings (2.1%), chiller COP (5.9%), using shading (9.1%), and building location (3.0%), respectively, could reduce energy consumption. The analysis discovered that using a well-performing HVAC system and building shading were effective in lowering the amount of energy used, and the energy modelling method could be an effective and satisfactory tool in determining potential energy savings."
