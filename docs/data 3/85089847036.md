## Abstract
"As the window-to-wall ratio, a microclimatic factor in residential districts, regulates the indoor thermal environment and implicates the energy consumption, this research was aimed at interpreting the microclimate effects of the window-to-wall ratio on the indoor thermal environment of the non-Hvac building located in the block from the view of a full year. Urban built parameters and building material parameters applied in Chenzhou were investigated, with the ENVI-met model serving as the analytical tool calculating the meteorological data recorded in the local national meteorological station. The thermal perception criterion of Chenzhou citizens was investigated, and thermal isotherms were employed to interpret the thermal perception distribution throughout the year. Analytical results revealed that the annual indoor thermal environment would deteriorate along with the growth of the window-to-wall ratio in Chenzhou, with the very hot thermal perception environment covering the months from March to October once the window-to-wall ratio outnumbered 60.00%. Furthermore, the hot and very hot thermal perception environments originated in the ranges of 0.00% to 20.00% and that of 20.00% to 40.00%, respectively. Furthermore, if the window-to-wall ratios (WWRs) outnumbered 40%, their effects on the indoor thermal perception environment would gradually decrease and be powerless once that exceeded 80%."
