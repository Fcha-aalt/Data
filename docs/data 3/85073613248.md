## Abstract
"A new system solution has been developed and tested by the authors and has been shown to improve the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating (SEER) of fixed-speed condenser split-system residential heat pumps. This is achieved through the use of a low power electronic drive that allows components with PSC motors (such as fans and compressors) to operate at multiple low speeds or variable speeds when partial capacity is required. At full capacity, the electronic drive is disabled and the PSC motors are operated at fixed speeds dictated by the frequency of the power source. Previous research by the authors has shown that fixed-speed heat pumps driven by rotary compressors with PSC motors achieve significantly greater improvements in performance and in overall SEER when operated with the electronic drive than similar heat pumps driven by scroll compressors with PSC motors. The current research measures the compressor and drive performance through calorimeter testing. This paper presents the results of testing a dual rotary PSC compressor in variable speed mode in association with the new electronic drive. The purpose of this testing is to understand how an off-the-shelf compressor with a PSC motor intended for fixed-speed operation performs under variable speed operation. Preliminary results of testing a PSC scroll compressor in variable speed mode with the electronic drive are also presented for comparison with the rotary compressor. Future research will focus on testing other common HVAC compressor technologies and employing mechanistic compressor models in order to better understand the parameters which affect the performance of PSC driven compressors under variable speed operation."
