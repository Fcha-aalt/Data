## Abstract
"Nowadays, energy has become a key player in the AEC industry because of the increase in global warming and energy crisis. Due to global warming the consumption of energy has increased enormously in buildings. The no. of buildings have grown in tandem with rise in levels of urbanization in developing & developed countries, which in return rises the bar for energy consumption. The improved energy performance of the building is significantly influenced by both interior and exterior building factors. It is preferred to perform energy analysis in the design stage of the building. The current paper is the talks about the energy model by improving the design of a conventional buildings, an energy - efficient model is been created which uses less energy and reduces its carbon footprint. Energy analysis using BIM can be used to optimize the building's design and identify opportunities for improvement, such as implementing energy-saving technologies, improving insulation and air tightness, and reducing energy loss through window frames, it's glazing type and also redesigning the other parameters including HVAC types, Window shades, change in orientation etc. In the earlier, the conventional model to produce energy through renewable sources like solar and wind, and incorporate them into the building's design. Thus, obtained results after analysis can be used to take design decisions and ensure the building meets energy efficiency standards and sustainability goals. The use of BIM in the design and analysis of energy-efficient buildings can help support the transition to a low-carbon, sustainable future."
