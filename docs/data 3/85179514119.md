## Abstract
"University facilities are required to make great effort for decarbonization, from the perspective of education and social cooperation. However, university facilities have a various kind of rooms with different uses, making it a difficult to efficient operation of HVAC systems with high energy consumption ratios. As VRF room air conditioner becomes more widely used, it is expected that more facilities will adopt VRF room air conditioning systems. In this study, we analyzed the energy consumption and energy efficiency improvement by energy management of New Minoh Campus of Osaka University as an example of urban type campus.."
