## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 12 papers. The topics discussed include: demand response through price-setting multi-agent reinforcement learning; electricity pricing aware deep reinforcement learning based intelligent HVAC control; a centralized soft actor critic deep reinforcement learning approach to district demand side management through CityLearn; benchmarking multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithms on a building energy demand coordination task; less is more: simplified state-action space for deep reinforcement learning based HVAC control; continual adaptation in deep reinforcement learning-based control applied to non-stationary building environments; a comparison of model-free and model predictive control for price responsive water heaters; flexible reinforcement learning framework for building control using EnergyPlus-Modelica energy models; and augmenting reinforcement learning with a planning model for optimizing energy demand response in a prospective experiment."
