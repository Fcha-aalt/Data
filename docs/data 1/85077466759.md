## Abstract
"Sensing technologies integration in buildings has grown rapidly. Most of them are connected to platforms for monitoring data and notifying anomalies, but few are integrated within building elements (either for data collection or response). These technologies help regulate HVAC, or detect building systems’ failures, but few enable passive sustainable strategies or space maintenance. It is possible to enhance building responsive operation by gathering granular data on passive systems’ operation and space occupation by setting a building component, that houses a sensor network. That is, if plugged into Building Information Models, it permits adaptation to unusual climate conditions or abrupt space use [Linked with the following correlated research projects: Research title: 2017, ELISIR.
