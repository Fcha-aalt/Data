## Abstract
"In this paper, the use of Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) materials as an option for the energy efficiency enhancement of HVAC systems is investigated. In particular, the possibility of using MOFs as dehumidifying materials to reduce the latent load associated with the moisture content of the airflows is studied. A literature review is proposed, highlighting the benefits of using MOFs instead of other adsorbents (e.g., silica-gel) and discussing the unique features (high water uptake capacity and low regeneration temperatures) that make MOFs a preferential desiccant. The possibility to finely tune these properties is also underlined, reporting some explicative examples. A theoretical proposal of a psychrometric transformation, to be performed in a HVAC system equipped with a MOF-Assisted Dehumidifier (MAD), is presented. This transformation is compared with a traditional one (cooling and dehumidification operated by a cooling coil with low temperatures of the coolant). The preliminary numerical simulations, conducted on a reference case study in Florence, Italy, show an estimated energy saving of 30–50%, leading us to consider the use of this technology as a very competitive one in the air-conditioning sector."
