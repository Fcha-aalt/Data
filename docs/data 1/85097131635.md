## Abstract
"This poster compares energy use of the campus of the University of Texas at Austin during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 to that of previous years. Our results show change in weekly aggregate chilled water and electricity consumption as a result of changes in building operation schedules and the response of utility demand to changing occupancy."
