## Abstract
"Heat pump systems become preferable for heating and cooling in buildings due to economic benefits resulting from high COP. The COP and energy efficiency are closely associated. This chapter begins with a discussion of sustainable energy development. In addition to energy efficiency, other key dimensions of building performance are also examined. Next, the four subsystems of HVAC, namely cool generation, heat generation, water transport, and air transport, are investigated. After examining options for cool generation and heat generation, heat pump systems to provide sustainable heating and cooling are discussed. The comparison between air source heat pump and water source heat pump is presented. Strategies to enhance energy efficiency of heat pump system are also discussed. To adopt the principle of 3R (i.e., reduce, reuse, and recycle), the use of recover heat in heat pump system for space heating and water heating is also examined."
