## Abstract
"Multiple thermal comfort models were developed for occupants in spaces with centralized HVAC systems. However, the thermal comfort modeling in microenvironments created by the personal conditioning device (PCD) is different because of the local non-uniform thermal stimuli on occupant bodies. This study compares the thermal sensation and comfort predictive performances of multiple machine learning models developed based on the wrist temperature and heart rate variability (HRV) collected in human subject experiments. In our results, the k nearest neighbors (KNN) outperforms the other machine learning methods, with the F1 score higher than 0.9 for both thermal sensation and comfort category classification, which indicates its suitability for comfort modeling for the PCD."
