## Abstract
"This paper addresses an implementation plan for the smart asset management of a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system, based on Air-to-Water Heat Pumps. Such plan aims to ensure a low cost and efficient asset management based on the use of Virtual Sensors (VS) and Fault Impact Models. An automated Fault Diagnostics (FD) approach ensures the improvement of energy efficiency in conjunction with a reduction on faults occurrence and service costs. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to apply the know-how already acquired about this technology and thus, develop a profitable strategy of smart asset management implementation through an on-condition based maintenance."
