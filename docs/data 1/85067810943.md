## Abstract
"In recent times, the use of industrial Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems has had a substantial increase due to various social-economic reasons. Various studies are conducted to address the concerns of noise generated by HVAC systems in particular from compressors; noise pollution affects the environment we live in and should therefore be mitigated as much as possible. For this purpose, an active noise reduction system is introduced to help alleviate noise levels at both low and high frequency ranges of the HVAC system. This paper demonstrates an implementation of Active Noise Reduction (ANR) system using Least Mean Square (LMS) and Filtered-x Least Mean Square (FxLMS) algorithms, which have been tested based on simulated noise scenarios. A comparison between both algorithms will be performed based on simulation of different frequency ranges which closely resembles the operating scenario of the industrial HVAC systems. Also, different values of step-size affecting the processing of the ANR system during the convergence rate and stability state will also be investigated and discussed."
