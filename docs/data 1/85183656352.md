## Abstract
"In order to reduce global energy consumption, energy-efficient, green and smart buildings should be built. In addition to the application of other energy efficiency measures, effective management of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are also required. High-quality management and control of those systems ensures optimal occupant comfort, proper operation, rational energy consumption, and a positive impact on the environment. This is especially important for large buildings with complex systems such as hotels. As a contribution to the creation of appropriate tools for the management and control of HVAC systems in smart buildings, this paper presents the results of the development of a detailed dynamic simulation model based on data collected from a smart room system in a hotel in Zagreb, Croatia. The smart room system provides historical data on a set and actual room temperatures, occupancy schedule, windows openings, fan coil unit (FCU) operating status, fan speed, control valve opening, and heating or cooling modes with a time step of 5 minutes. The simulation model based on TRNSYS software uses part of the available data and predicts the room temperatures. A comparison of the predicted and measured temperatures at each time step shows that the deviations of the manually calibrated model are within acceptable standardized limits. The developed model has been applied to identify major anomalies in the operation of the FCU system, yielding promising results."
