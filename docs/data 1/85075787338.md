## Abstract
"Construction industry is the pillar industry of country. Its development reflects the level of national economic construction. Quality of construction is also directly related to urban development. HVAC design is an integral and important part of architectural design. Comfort, durability and energy efficiency of construction project will depend on quality of HVAC design. Therefore, HVAC design has always been the content of interest in architectural design. In the actual process of HVAC design, there are some problems that hinder the smooth progress of HVAC design which affect the overall quality of building. Based on this, this study mainly focused on analysis of the existing problems in HVAC design of building and proposed corresponding improvement measures. Hopefully this can provide suggestions as reference for current HVAC design and improve the conditions of HVAC design of building, in achieving the ultimate rationalization of HVAC design."
