## Abstract
"Modeling and predicting building infiltration impact on building energy performance presents a challenge. This paper analyses the modeling method of infiltration rates in different simulation programs. Field blower door test results of building infiltration rates are compared and summarized. Based on literature simulation and field study data, this research analyses the building infiltration rates on the office building HVAC energy use under various climate conditions. Suggested and preferred infiltration rates under various climates are listed."
