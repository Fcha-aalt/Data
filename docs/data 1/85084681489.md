## Abstract
"An already existing aquaponics facility in Jordan, named Khodra, will be used to evaluate the cooling and heating profiles to provide the best environment for plants and fish to thrive. A replica of the 'Khodra' facility will be simulated to be built in Qatar. Good ventilation rate with 50% green color shading was sufficient to reduce the temperature down by almost 10 degrees in 'Khodra'-Jordan while using a heating, ventilation and air conditioning water-chiller based system reduced the humidity in the 'Khodra'-Qatar greenhouse yet using AC split units was cheaper for the small size, 360 m2, of this specific greenhouse."
