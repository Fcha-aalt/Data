## Abstract
"In a last decade, there is a tremendous growth in geothermal and aero-thermal heat pump market. Reason for this growth is commitment to highly energy-efficient, low-carbon EU economy. Trends in installation of heat pumps in Croatia are similar to global scale of EU, but somewhat slower. Climate of northern part of Croatia classifies as Dfb, by KÃ¶ppen and Geiger scale (humid continental climate with warm to hot summers and cold winters). This makes it ideal region for implementation of heat pump systems, moreover geological setting is mostly clastic sedimentary rocks spanning stratigraphically from the Precambrium to the Quaternary, often saturated with groundwater. Analysis of comparative energy and economy advantages of heating and cooling with heat pump systems (air, ground or groundwater) was made for capital city of Zagreb. Wider Zagreb city area has especially favourable hydrogeological and thermogeological parameters, which allows implementation of different designs for residential and commercial heating and cooling. Since heat pump systems in residential area is always higher-class investment, there is often a need for all-year round heating since projects increasingly incorporate outside swimming pool. Many authors investigated comparison of winter heating energy cost for different heat pump systems. However, outdoor swimming pool sometimes consumes as much heating energy during spring-summer season, as do house in autumn-winter season. Since air temperatures during spring-summer season are much more favourable then subcooled ground temperatures, air-source heat pumps when used in whole year round for heating could offset economically unfavourable COP during coldest days of winter. On a real residential home, currently in construction phase, techno-economical analysis was performed comparing seasonal performance factor (SPF) for different heat pump systems during whole year round heating."
