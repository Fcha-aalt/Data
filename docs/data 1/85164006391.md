## Abstract
"A fault diagnosis method of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems based on the ReliefF-recursive feature elimination based on cross validation-support vector machine (ReliefF-RFECV-SVM) combined model is proposed to enhance the diagnosis accuracy and efficiency. The method initially uses ReliefF to screen the original features, selecting those that account for 95% of the total weight. The recursive feature elimination based on cross validation (RFECV), based on a random forest classifier, is then applied to select the optimal feature subset according to diagnostic accuracy. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) model is constructed for fault classification. The method is tested on seven typical faults of the ASHRAE 1043-RP water chiller dataset and three typical faults of an air-cooled self-built air conditioner simulation dataset. The results show that the ReliefF-RFECV-SVM method significantly reduces diagnosis time compared to SVM, shortening it by about 50% based on the ASHRAE 1043-RP dataset, while achieving an overall accuracy of 99.98%. Moreover, the proposed method achieves a comprehensive diagnosis accuracy of 99.97% on the self-built simulation dataset, with diagnosis time the reduced by about 65% compared to single SVM."
