## Abstract
"Interest in environmental, social, and governance-focused investments has been on the rise as investors look to address critical issues such as climate change, diversity, human rights, and company stewardship, to name a few. At the same time, sustainable investing is at an inflection point. As attention shifts away from how people invest, the focus is migrating to the outcomes of those decisions, such as thinking proactively about how our actions affect the environment. Initially, environmental concerns were addressed primarily through exclusionary practices and avoidance of investments in industries that were deemed harmful to the planet. However, the dialogue has evolved to include more proactive measures with outcomes, including reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, water conservation, and air quality improvement. As property owners look to make building upgrades addressing energy efficiency, renewable energy, water conservation, HVAC concerns, and resiliency measures, property assessed clean energy programs can play a vital role in financing such initiatives."
