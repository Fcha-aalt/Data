## Abstract
"The local wind environment and daylight conditions of buildings directly affect the safety and comfort (e.g. thermal environment and lighting environment) of the residents and staff, and influence the energy consumption and energy efficiency of building's operation. However, in the view of a planning designer, it is likely to pay more attention to the building's functional arrangement, appearance and space utilization, but the problems of area ventilation and daylight condition may be neglected. This paper takes a layout design of a commercial building group in Haidong, Qinghai Province as an example to demonstrate, for an urban planner, how to use the CFD and building lighting simulation technology to carry out the preliminary evaluation on an initial design scheme. Simulation results indicated under local meteorological conditions, the initial design scheme fully considered the cold air infiltration in winter and natural ventilation in summer, as well as safety issues in the human walking area, which formed a good local wind environment. However, the problem of poor daylight condition in some areas requires adjustments and modifications based on actual circumstance. From the examples presented in this paper, the numerical simulation techniques play an important role at the initial stages of planning and design to detect the design defects timely and provides a basis for subsequent adjustments later. Meanwhile, this paper also provides a reference for interdisciplinary cooperation between urban planners and HVAC engineers."
