## Abstract
"The editor of this special issue on “Intelligent Control in Energy Systems” have made an attempt to publish a book containing original technical articles addressing various elements of intelligent control in energy systems. The response to our call had 60 submissions, of which 27 were published submissions and 33 were rejections. This book contains 27 technical articles and one editorial. All have been written by authors from 15 countries (China, Netherlands, Spain, Tunisia, United States of America, Korea, Brazil, Egypt, Denmark, Indonesia, Oman, Canada, Algeria, Mexico, and Czech Republic), which elaborated several aspects of intelligent control in energy systems. It covers a broad range of topics including fuzzy PID in automotive fuel cell and MPPT tracking, neural network for fuel cell control and dynamic optimization of energy management, adaptive control on power systems, hierarchical Petri Nets in microgrid management, model predictive control for electric vehicle battery and frequency regulation in HVAC systems, deep learning for power consumption forecasting, decision tree for wind systems, risk analysis for demand side management, finite state automata for HVAC control, robust µ-synthesis for microgrid, and neuro-fuzzy systems in energy storage."
