## Abstract
"The present study presents the bin weather data for four cities in the tropical region and its significance in the building energy analysis. The bin weather data for four cities in Malaysia, which are Bayan Lepas, Kuala Terengganu, Senai and Kuching, were generated. The bin weather data are in the range from 18 to 38 °C with 2 °C intervals and tabulated based on six 4-h shifts. Since there is a lack of updated bin weather data in Malaysia, the present paper provides valuable data for engineers and designers to conduct an energy analysis using the bin method in this region. This data may also serve as an important reference for all tropical regions with similar weather characteristics. Energy analysis is an important tool for estimating the energy usage of a building in order to minimize energy wastage and maximize energy efficiency. The significance of applying bin weather data in energy analysis is also investigated using a case simulation. When the mean outdoor temperature of occupied period is used in simulation, the results deviate less than 1.6% from the results with the bin weather data, but the deviation rises up to 16.68% with the use of the annual mean outdoor dry bulb temperature."
