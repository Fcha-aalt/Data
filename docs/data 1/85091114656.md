## Abstract
"The optimization of HVAC system is an important part of building energy conservations. As a complex nonlinear system with large inertia and large lag, the traditional HVAC system adjusts temperature based on the current indoor temperature, so that the control does not involve future changes. Therefore, accurately predicting the building indoor temperature will help more stable control and provide a reference for system tuning. Air handling unit dataset, which is established by the US Department of Energy for experiments, is used in this article, and the long short-term memory (LSTM) model is also used to predict the temperature. The MAE of predictions of the final model is about 0.077 °F, and the RMSE is about 0.107 °F. The experimental results show that the LSTM can efficiently learn the trends and features of the data, and higher prediction accuracy than the traditional back propagation neural network (BP) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP)."
