## Abstract
"The main purpose of healthcare facilities is to treat patients, enhance and maintain public health and help patients to spend a healthier life after their treatment. Yet considerably higher energy consumption rates in the healthcare facilities with respect to other commercial building types results in increased service costs which contradicts the mentioned goals. Providing the public with adequate, proper and timely health services may not be possible without cutting down preventable operation costs. In this research possible solutions for reducing energy consumptions of hospital buildings are investigated with the aim of decreasing the energy and consequently service costs. In this regard a prototype hospital building is studied by developing its energy model compliant with local codes and regulations. Later, this model is used as baseline to evaluate the enhancement of integrated design parameters like building orientation and window to wall ratio along with improvements to building systems which have a significant impact on building energy performance such as HVAC, lighting and building envelope systems. Moreover, effectiveness of each parameter is compared for four different climate zones. It was observed that by applying appropriate architectural, electrical and mechanical enhancements and utilizing renewable energy systems significant levels of energy conservation could be achieved and emission rates could be cut down nearly by half."
