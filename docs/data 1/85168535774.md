## Abstract
"This paper discusses the use of advanced monitoring techniques for optimal control of building management systems (BMS) in public buildings, with the objective of guaranteeing the appropriate air quality, minimizing energy consumption. The paper reviews the current state of BMS technologies, and the challenges associated with reducing energy consumption in public buildings. It then discusses the potential benefits of advanced monitoring techniques and their application in BMS, including improved energy efficiency, occupant comfort, and indoor air quality. The analysis conducted highlights the challenges in establishing a direct relationship between monitoring data and HVAC system control, emphasizing the potential of Machine Learning algorithms in addressing this issue."
