## Abstract
"The building sector, representing a significant share of energy consumption, accounts for 60 % of energy consumption, particularly in Heating, Ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC). Phase change materials (PCMs), distinguished by their ability to store and release substantial heat in response to ambient temperature changes, emerge as promising solutions for integrating thermal regulation technologies in building design. While literature showcases studies demonstrating the incorporation of PCMs into various building materials, there is a dearth of comprehensive reviews covering their integration into building components. This study classifies PCMs based on material composition and the nature of phase change, presenting a brief overview to highlight their diverse applications in the thermal regulation of buildings. Further, it summarizes various studies on PCM incorporation in building materials such as roofs, walls, cement, bricks, paints, floors, and windows, bridging the gap in existing research. Solid-liquid organic PCMs are widely researched compared to inorganic and solid-solid PCMs for building applications. Solid-liquid PCMs require containment for liquid state handling during phase changes, mainly applied in encapsulated forms. Building components such as bricks and floors can incorporate PCMs in any encapsulated form. Based on the Review findings, adding PCM to cement plaster often reduces mechanical properties and increases cement porosity, impacting the hydration process, except when using dopamine-coated cenosphere PCM capsules. Phase change paints, primarily utilizing micro/nano encapsulated PCMs, reveal varying effects on paint properties based on the percentage of PCM capsules added, with peak temperature reductions of 1–6 °C observed in building applications. Solid-solid PCMs are primarily applied in windows, where PCM-filled glazed windows significantly reduce peak temperatures up to 9 °C. Reduction in peak temperatures from 1 °C–7 °C and heat loads by 19–59 % were observed for PCM integrated in Roof. South-faced walls equipped with PCM layers exhibit superior thermal performance compared to other orientations. In conclusion, this review consolidates recent advancements and provides valuable insights into PCM applications in various building components, serving as a valuable resource for researchers, engineers, and industrial experts."
