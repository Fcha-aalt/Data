## Abstract
"Global warming has become an important problem because excessive energy use can increase CO 2 emissions. Building control techniques for energy saving have been performed using conventional and scheduling methods. Although building controls have been based on user schedules, both methods have disadvantages due to device automation based on the maximum occupancy in the room. Therefore, smart buildings have limitations to adapt to environmental alteration. We propose a model of control techniques based on user presence, location and the number of occupants in the room. The aim is to increase the energy efficiency in buildings. To evaluate our approach, we compared our model using conventional and scheduling method. This model shows 25 % and 16% potential energy savings respectively, whereas compared with the conventional and scheduling method."
