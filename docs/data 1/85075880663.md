## Abstract
"The paper presents a multi-agent system simulation for improving the quality of life and energy efficiency in smart-homes. The scope of this framework is in the context of the iLight Eurostars project which has the objective of creating an indoor monitoring system using energy-efficient smart luminaires. The current work extends the previous work in monitoring with the implementation of ambient control by assigning responsibilities to the software agents that control HVAC elements and allowing them to communicate in order to fulfill their assigned responsibilities related to temperature, light, humidity comfort levels. A software agent architecture is introduced with dedicated roles for device, goal and environment agents. The multi agent system is implemented in Magentix2 framework, with a business layer and front-end in Java Enterprise Edition for administration and visualization."
