## Abstract
"Accurate calculations and predictions of heating and cooling loads in buildings play an important role in the development and implementation of building energy management plans. This study aims to improve the forecasting accuracy of cooling load predictions using an optimized nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) neural network model. The preprocessing of training data and optimization of parameters were investigated for model optimization. In predictive models of cooling loads, the removal of missing values and the adjustment of structural parameters have been shown to help improve the predictive performance of a neural network model. In this study, preprocessing the training data eliminated missing values for times when the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning system is not running. Also, the structural and learning parameters were adjusted to optimize the model parameters."
