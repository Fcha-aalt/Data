## Abstract
"The building sector demands energy to service occupant comfort and amenity. Thermal energy is sustainably serviced to the built environment via efficient mechanical heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and plumbing systems. Efficient mechanical HVAC/plumbing systems exploit thermodynamics and energy conversions. Mechanical systems synchronized with the natural environment foster sustainability in their effort to effectively source and service thermal energy. Insight on mechanical system feasibility will provide justification of their future implementation. Performance, application, and limitations of mechanical solutions will be analysed for selection. Energy harvesting/storage/recovery can achieve significant merits to our people, planet, and profit. Reviewed distributed heat pump system heat recovery for a case study building with simultaneous heating and cooling demands resulted in a 17% reduction of thermal energy consumption."
