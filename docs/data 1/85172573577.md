## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 56 papers. The topics discussed include: integration of statistical models of residential HVAC loads with a commercial smart thermostat; utility models for harmonic analysis; a comparative analysis of GridPIQâ€™s fossil fuel dispatch algorithm; effects of environmental influences on active thermography to detect the inner structures of wind turbine rotor blades; YoMoPie: a user-oriented energy monitor to enhance energy efficiency in households; techno-economic analysis of a battery energy storage system with combined stationary and mobile applications; investigation of heat transfer through multi jet heat exchangers utilizing local thermal non-equilibrium model; and predictive analytics to estimate level of residential participation in residential demand response program."
