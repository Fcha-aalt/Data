## Abstract
"All over the world, the construction sector is the largest consumer of energy, which has a negative impact on the environment. In this article, the research methodology is adopting building information modeling (BIM) technology in 3D simulation and energy analysis. This study aims using BIM technology to improve indoor daylight performance of the building, determine the proper and comfortable artificial lighting of the building and their costs compared with the traditional methods used to calculate lighting, calculate the amount of renewable energy and cost saving that can be obtained from the photovoltaic panels, assess energy performance analysis at design stage and then create design alternatives to increase energy efficiency. The idea of this research was applied in one of the Iraqi projects; the authors found that applying BIM technology helps a lot in increasing energy performance efficiency through many strategies and it also gives the ability to solve all problems related to the performance of energy in the design stage. The results concluded that applying BIM technology improves indoor daylight performance of the building where the artificial lighting reduce around (29 lamps) as well as the cost of lamps reduce around (6500ID), use photovoltaic(PV) panels reduce annual energy consumption around 44% as well as achieves cost-saving about (22,601 $/year), total electricity consumption equal to (421,645 kw h/year) and total fuel consumption equal to (565,633 MJ/year). Also, the results explain the HVAC system is the most effective alternative where annual energy saving is around (50%)."
