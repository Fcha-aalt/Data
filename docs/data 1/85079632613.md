## Abstract
"Estimating cooling loads in heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems is a complex task. This is mainly due to its dependence on numerous factors which are both intrinsic and extrinsic to buildings. These include climate, fore- casts, building material, fenestration etc. In addition, these factors are non-linear and time-varying. Therefore, capturing the effect of these parameters on the cooling load is a complex task. This investigation combines forward modelling, i.e., physics based model simulated using energyPlus with deep-learning techniques to build a cooling load estimator. The forward model captures all the time-varying factors influencing the cooling loads. We use the long short-term memory (LSTM), a deep-learning method to provide forecasts of cooling loads. The advantage of the proposed approach is that cooling load estimations can be provided in real-time thus providing sort of soft-sensor for estimating cooling loads in buildings. The proposed approach is illustrated on a building of suitable scale and our results demonstrates the ability of the tool to provide forecasts."
