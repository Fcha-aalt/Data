## Abstract
"In 2020, buildings accounted for 40% of EU final energy consumption and 36% of GHG emissions, a significant share of which is due to supermarkets, which are among the most energy intensive buildings. Supermarkets are also interesting for their potential to serve as energy transition change agents due to their role in the social fabric of local communities (e.g.: influencing citizens to make sustainable actions and choices). To reduce energy consumption in supermarkets, the EU co-funded SUPER-HEERO project is developing a replicable financial scheme for energy efficiency investments in small/medium supermarkets, based on stakeholder engagement. In the Project, based on an analysis of typical supermarkets’ energy uses, a catalogue of 42 energy efficiency interventions was created, covering overall energy management, improvement of energy supply and main energy uses, i.e. HVAC, lighting, products refrigeration, etc. One ambition is to demystify energy renovation packages and make supermarket stakeholders more likely to take action. In this paper, 18 energy efficiency renovation packages are created for supermarkets based on: baseline energy conditions, geographical location, renovation depth and associated investment needs. All KPIs for renovation packages are presented per unit of floor area to allow, with a certain degree of accuracy, extrapolation for supermarkets of different sizes. The work done demonstrates how a wide range of opportunities for energy efficiency-oriented renovation of supermarkets exist, characterized by a limited investment, a reduction of energy uses and GHG emissions of 20–30% and a payback below 5–6 years. The best cost–benefit ratio is found for “basic” renovation packages applied to old supermarkets, since they focus on “low-hanging fruits”; actions on supermarkets in better conditions might be less profitable but interesting and/or required to meet corporate strategies, especially engaging stakeholders like in SUPER-HEERO innovative financing scheme."
