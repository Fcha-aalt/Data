## Abstract
"Humidity, not temperature, is the primary determinant of building comfort and health. If humidity could be properly controlled with existing technologies, then people would set their thermostats at 74Â°F or higher in summer. Why aren't they? Thermostats have to be lowered to compensate for high relative humidity levels in buildings. The humidity control provided by traditional HVAC equipment does not meet comfort and health requirements. The presenter will provide an overview of humidity issues with existing HVAC technology in new and existing buildings. He will review new research into Third Generation Desiccant Technology that provides a complete solution to both temperature and humidity control. Increases in energy efficiencies and moisture removal performance will be shown, as well as lower first cost for equipment. Revolutionary process design breakthroughs that allow the integration of low temperature heat recovery and renewable energy into the equipment design will be discussed. Existing and newly built buildings suffer from problems in handling latent loads in almost all climatic regions of the world. Refrigerant compression systems remove humidity."
