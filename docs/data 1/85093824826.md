## Abstract
"The overall energy efficiency and indoor environmental quality of new and existing buildings is significantly influenced by the effective operation of the building's heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) system. Achieving high performance on today's buildings requires HVAC systems to operate at optimal conditions and with minimal energy consumption. Recent data obtained from Saudi Electricity Corporation has shown that HVAC systems in residential and commercial buildings consume about 65% of total power production. The need of energy management to reduce the energy consumption in such buildings becomes crucial not only because of the end-of-the month bill, but also for environment risk-free issues. The study investigates experimentally the impact on energy consumption to eliminate the fan from the fan coil unit (FCU). Instead of a large central fan, indoor air will be distributed using small fans powered by solar energy mounted inside each interior comfort zone. This would improve access to separate comfort zone controls and positively affect thermal comfort in those areas. Enhancement of the heat transfer between the circulated water and the air in the zone is also of interest.This proposed technology will not only substantially reduce energy consumption and alleviate greenhouse gas emissions caused by fossil fuel use; it should also reduce the noise produced by the fan of the unit that shares the same space. This will decrease indoor noise pollution and improve acoustics. Noise pollution is often cited as a major irritant by office workers. In addition, it is possible that smaller, separated fans could achieve more complete air circulation which would improve indoor air quality."
