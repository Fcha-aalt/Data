## Abstract
"Introduction: Investment in the development of intelligent communication networks is facilitating greater internet connectivity. The paper examines the utilization of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and hypothesizes about their potential effect on building energy efficiency and comfort. Objetive: Understand the potential of IoT-based applications to enhance energy efficiency and optimize the indoor temperature in buildings by regulating the operation of pre-existing heating equipment. Methods: The main costs and benefits associated with the application of intelligent technologies as a measure to rationalize energy consumption in buildings are discussed in order to support decision-making. Results: It is expected that the adoption of IoT solutions as intelligent, low-intrusion and low-cost environmental monitoring and management systems will make it possible to control thermal comfort and increase the energy efficiency of buildings. Conclusion: The study reveals the potential of IoT to reduce energy consumption through the intelligent management of HVAC systems in existing buildings. In many of these structures, given the large investment involved in replacing less efficient climate control systems, adopting this type of technology is a cheap solution for reducing energy costs. It is hoped that this analysis will act as a catalyst for greater energy efficiency by adopting IoT technologies in various public and private sectors."
