## Abstract
"Increasing the energy efficiency of HVAC systems for rooms in chemical and petrochemical industries during their temperature control is an important problem. A mathematical model is proposed for determining the values of indoor air temperatures and surface temperatures of envelopes in order to calculate the predicted values of heat flows in building and structures. An experimental research showing the relevance of the proposed methodology was conducted."
