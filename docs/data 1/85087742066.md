## Abstract
"This paper presents a novel integrated pseudo-decentralized fault-diagnosis and fault-tolerant approach based on the pseudo-decentralized economic model predictive control (pDeMPC) strategy for an HVAC system in a multi-zone building. Feedback linearization is employed to cancel out the bilinear and Hammerstein terms, thereby, resulting in an easily handleable linear system. A full order state-observer is designed to estimate the unmeasured wall temperatures of the zone because shared walls are the primary source of coupling between the interconnected zones. With this complete state information, the system is decomposed into control-oriented thermal models of individual zones. Subsequently, an integrated pseudo-decentralized fault-diagnosis and fault-tolerant approach based on pDeMPC scheme which utilizes the interaction among the zones is designed which can be easily scaled to buildings with a large number of zones, thereby, making it suitable for real-time implementation. SIMulation of Building and Devices (SIMBAD) toolbox is used for demonstrating the effectiveness of control and monitoring approach on a one floor, three-zone building."
