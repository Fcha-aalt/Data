## Abstract
"Predicting the compressor performance is an essential part in the design and optimization of HVAC&R equipment. The AHRI standard polynomial equations are well suited to map the performance of single-stage fixed-speed positive displacement machines, but present a number of well documented shortcomings especially in the case of compression enhancements (e.g. oil-flooding, injection, variable-speed). To this end, a Multi-Input Multi-Output Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model has been developed to map the performance of single-phase and two-phase injected scroll compressors. The ANN models are based on a multi-layer structure whose number of neurons has been optimized to obtain high-accuracy predictions. The models have been developed by using the open-source Keras package. The trained ANN models have been compared with the current state-of-the-art correlations available and they outperformed the existing correlations in terms of accuracy."
