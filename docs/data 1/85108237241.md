## Abstract
"Due to an error in production, a number of corrections that the authors requested were not made in the final published version of the paper. The following changes should be considered to the paper: Page 2 – In the last sentence of the first paragraph, the phrase ‘billing information’ is repeated, the sentence should read ‘Without appliance-level information, machine learning can be used to disaggregate high temporal resolution smart-meter data [26–29], but those data are often also unavailable, forcing programs to proceed with low resolution billing information analyses.’ – In the last paragraph of the introduction the term ‘2% and 2% respectively’ should be replaced with ‘2% each’, with the sentence reading ‘While some studies have found that higher efficiency lightbulbs lead to additional heating and reduced cooling needs due to a change in total heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) use [33, 34], the California Public Utilities Commission finds that the additional HVAC electricity and reduced gas savings for the City of Palo Alto’s climate zone is only around 2% each [35].’ Page 3 – In table 1, in the description for ‘CFL bulb’, the term ‘CPAU’ should be ‘CPA’ – In the second paragraph the word ‘large’ should be larger, the sentence should be ‘The difference in usage rates for natural gas versus electricity is mirrored in figure 1, which shows a larger percentage difference between seasons for natural gas than for electricity’ Page 5 – There is a comma missing between two references in a list in the second paragraph of the ‘Modeling strategy’ section, the list should read ‘Ito, Fowlie et al, Boomhower and Davis, Novan and Smith, and Zivin and Novan’ Page 6 There are errors in equations 3 and 4, these should be as follows: Page 8 – The caption for figure 5 is missing the end of the last sentence, it should read ‘Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals clustered at the household level.’ Page 9 – The first paragraph of the ‘Exploratory investigation of unexpected effects’ section is missing some hyphenated terms: ‘pre and post-treatment’ (two instances) and ‘pre-and post program’ should be ‘pre-and post-treatment’ and ‘pre-and post-program’, respectively – In the second paragraph of the same section, the term ‘(95%CI: 0.3% to 07%)’ should be ‘(95%CI: 0.3% to 7%)’ – The phrase ‘95% confidence intervals clustered at the household level.’ should have been removed from between the second and third paragraphs (as noted above, this should have been part of the caption for figure 5). Page 10 – The title ‘Comparison with savings from the CPAU’ should have been expanded to ‘Comparison with savings from the City of Palo Alto Utilities (CPAU)’ Page 11 – In the second paragraph, a comma should have been removed from the second sentence, it should read ‘For example, a household may claim the LED lights rebate when undergoing a major home remodel’ – In the third paragraph the word approached was a typographical error that should have been approaches, the sentence should be ‘Our results are in line with earlier research that has found reductions in electricity consumption through the use of non-monetary approaches’. – In the last sentence of the Discussion, the word detecting should have been detect, the sentence should then read as ‘Our work, in addition to corroborating existing research on energy efficiency program effectiveness, provides a simple way to detect those unobserved changes using cross-energy treatment effects’."
