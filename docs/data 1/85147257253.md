## Abstract
"The behavior of buildings concerning energy usage has become difficult due to the various factors affecting energy usage. Nevertheless, using modern-day software has provided plenty of opportunities to forecast the energy performance of different building types once it is used. In the present study, an energy simulation tool is used to analyze the HVACs (Heating, ventilation, and Air-Cooling) system in a building to forecast its energy performance. To elaborate precisely on the statistics of the building, the factors under consideration include the outside climate of the building, use of construction materials, and heating resources in the building. Also, by observing the routine for estimating the energy demands of building and determining the needed resources and systems."
