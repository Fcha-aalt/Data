## Abstract
"Conventional refrigerants such as chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons have high values of global warming potential (GWP) and ozone depletion (ODP). HVAC&R engineers and designers are exploring alternate refrigerants having low ODP and GWP. At present, R32 refrigerant is being considered as an alternative to the conventional refrigerants in domestic air conditioners by many manufacturers and countries. This study analyzes the steady-state cooling performance of a split air conditioner using R32(CH2F2) and R32/CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) mixture having lower GWP. The performance of the air conditioner with R32 and four different compositions of R32/CO2 mixture is studied experimentally and numerically. A comparative analysis of performance characteristics such as cooling capacity, total energy consumption, energy efficiency, operating pressures and temperatures is presented in this study."
