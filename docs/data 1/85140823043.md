## Abstract
"This paper proposed new strategies for investigating the reality of indoor air quality (IAQ). The actual crowded cell was simulated by scale of 1:4 containing five persons in which two of them are lying. It was aimed to keep the stability of the oxygen / air ratio to prevent suffocation by controlling the air velocity as quickly as possible from HVAC systems, especially in the overcrowded area. Phase change materials (PCMs) were used to reduce the fluctuations of inside space temperatures for the thermal performance. Two different organic PCMs were used to analyse the temperature distribution in the prototype model. This study also is focused on the analysis of the thermal efficiency of PCMs that is established on thermal energy storage (TES) for energy embalmment in the prototype model, for thermal management of special zone temperature applications. In addition, temperature distributions inside the cell with and without the embedded PCM in the ceiling have been illustrated. Using of PCM has reduced the cell temperature about 7Â°C."
