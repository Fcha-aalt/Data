## Abstract
"Phase change materials have received many attentions during last years owing to their potentials for thermal energy storage. High latent heat of these materials enables improved storage density that translates into compact form factors of a thermal energy storage unit. Phase change materials (PCMs) can be integrated with various energy systems, such as solar systems, building energy systems, HVAC, domestic water heaters, cooling of electronics devices, etc. For more exploiting the energy flexibility of the PCMs combined with energy systems, the optimization and prediction of PCMs in such systems are important. Due to the time-consuming of the optimization processes, high potentials of machine learning techniques (MLTs) are proved. Moreover, the MLTs have also shown high potentials in controlling the predicted data by the models for PCMs integrated energy systems. In this study, a review on the applications of MLTs in energy systems combined with PCMs is conducted. The perspective and suggestions of MLTs in PCMs combined energy systems are provided as road map for future studies."
