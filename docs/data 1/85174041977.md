## Abstract
"This paper presents the concept of an innovative control of a central heating system in a multifamily building based on the original thermodynamic model, the resulting architecture of the control system, and the originally designed and manufactured wireless temperature sensors for thermal zones. The novelty of this solution is the developed layers of the control system: distributed measurement and correction analysis, which is based on the existing infrastructure and the local HVAC controller. This approach allows for the effective use of the measured temperature data from thermal zones and finally sending the value of the calculated correction of settings to the controller. Moreover, in the analytical layer, a model was also implemented that calculates the necessary amount of energy based on data from the subsystem of temperature sensors located in the thermal zones of the building. The use of the algorithmic strategy presented in this paper extends the functionality and significantly improves the energy efficiency of the existing, classic, reference heating control algorithm by implementing additional control loops. Additionally, it enables integration with demand-side response systems. The presented concept was successfully tested, achieving real energy savings for heating by 12%. These results are described in a case-study format. The authors believe that this concept can be used in other buildings and thus will have a positive impact on the energy savings used to maintain thermal comfort in buildings and significantly reduce CO2 emissions."
