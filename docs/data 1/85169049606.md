## Abstract
"Modern smart home control systems utilize realtime occupancy and activity monitoring to ensure control efficiency, occupants' comfort, and optimal energy consumption. Moreover, adopting machine learning-based anomaly detection models (ADMs) enhances security and reliability. However, sufficient system knowledge allows adversaries/attackers to alter sensor measurements through stealthy false data injection (FDI) attacks. Although ADMs limit attack scopes, the availability of information like occupants' location, conducted activities, and alteration capability of smart appliances increase the attack surface. Therefore, performing an attack space analysis of modern home control systems is crucial to design robust defense solutions. However, state-of-the-art analyzers do not consider contemporary control and defense solutions and generate trivial attack vectors. To address this, we propose a control and defense-aware novel attack analysis framework for a modern smart home control system, efficiently extracting ADM rules. We verify and validate our framework using a state-of-the-art dataset and a prototype testbed."
