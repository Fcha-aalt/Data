## Abstract
"This paper examines and compares energy consumption in a sample building to reduce energy consumption and obtain the best performance in reducing energy consumption. Energy Plus software has done the modeling and simulation of energy consumption for a hypothetical five-story building in the climate of Tehran. The hypotheses used in this study include the use of four types of phase-change materials (PCMs) with different melting temperatures and specific latent temperatures in the Interior and exterior walls of the building, use of four different types of insulation, including glass wool (fiberglass), rock wool, elastomer and polyurethane in the outer walls of the building, the effect of the ratio of window area to exterior walls of the building on energy consumption, the use of various HVAC terminal systems including air conditioners, radiators and fan coils in the building. This study shows that, in general, the highest energy consumption with an increase of 71% compared to the reference building was related to the use of 90% of the area of the window to the external walls of the building, and the lowest energy consumption with a decrease of 20.81% compared to the reference building was related to the use of polyurethane thermal insulation."
