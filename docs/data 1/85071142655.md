## Abstract
"The Smart Campus is a European project based in four pilots located in Helsinki (Metropolia University), Lisbon (Instituto Superior Técnico), Luleå (Technology University) and Milan (Politecnico di Milano), having engaged 76,000 users since August 2012 during 33 months. The main objective of this project was to demonstrate the central role of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) based services that act upon Energy Management Systems and control heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) and Lighting on achieving energy efficiency through dynamically negotiating building environmental conditions with the users on the University pilots. This paper presents the energy saving results and the best practices obtained in the Lisbon Pilot where ICT equipment was installed in a Library, a lecture Amphitheater and a set of offices. Overall savings were almost 40 % in some test locations. It was observed that energy savings were different between test locations due to particularities such as space typology, occupation and utilization patterns, equipment installed, HVAC and lighting control systems and users interaction."
