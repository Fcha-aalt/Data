## Abstract
"The carbon dioxide (CO2)-based demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) has attracted prompt attention from the Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) industry since its very first invention. Thereafter it has gone through several revolutions due to the rapid advancement in control and sensing technologies. Although a great variety of CO2-based DCV control strategies have been developed in the last two decades, there lacks a holistic literature review that systematically analyzes and summarizes advances and applications of CO2-based DCV in commercial buildings. This paper examines the recent advances in the CO2-based DCV in commercial buildings and focuses on discussing the control-related issues in the applications of the CO2-based DCV by collecting and assessing the available case studies in the recent two decades in terms of principles, complexity, and performance. First, principles of the different CO2-based DCV control strategies are elaborated, and their application scenarios are summarized from the case studies. Second, advancements in sensing technologies and actuating control devices are presented. On top of that, performance evaluation of the CO2-based DCV is conducted to (1) quantify the benefit achieved from the state-of-the-art CO2-based DCV; and (2) identify common issues and challenges associated with the design and field implementation of the CO2-based DCV. Finally, conclusions, limitations, and perspectives for future research are summarized."
