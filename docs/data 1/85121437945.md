## Abstract
"Energy and environmental targets are expressed clearly by the EU policies setting ambitious goals for 2030 and 2050 considering energy intensive sectors such as buildings. Pursuing high energy performance with the least environmental impact of a building, along with ensuring the well-being of the occupants, is the ultimate goal of an institutional framework that addresses energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. Part of this effort is the improvement of the building envelope's thermal performance, along with the respective one of HVAC systems, as those determine thee energy performance of buildings in their use phase. Main scope of the paper is to evaluate and analyse different scenarios considering the retrofitting of facades as part of the refurbishment towards Zero and Positive Energy Buildings, but also in connection with the strive for Net Zero Energy, Net Zero Cost Energy and Net Zero Emissions goals. The paper also discusses energy and environmental evaluation of refurbishing an office building in Greece, examining the performance of different envelope construction typologies and alternative insulation scenarios. These scenarios include state of the art insulation techniques, but also innovative design elements such as the use of different final coating materials for ventilated fa√ßades like the use of phase-changing materials (PCMs). The results of the assessment undertaken are used to rate the construction solutions by means of energy and environmental parameters proving the environmental impact of concrete and insulation materials in construction phase but also the reduced primary energy consumption and thus the CO2 emissions in the life cycle of the building. Considering the environmental evaluation, the carbon footprint analysis was used according to Greenhouse Gas Protocol focusing mainly on CO2 emissions, which is the main emission target of EU policies. The impact assessment followed demonstrated that the most significant impact categories are global warming, acidification and eutrophication."
