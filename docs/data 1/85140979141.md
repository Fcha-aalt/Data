## Abstract
"Most of the commonly used household appliances, for example, refrigerator, lighting and HVAC were modeled in a block diagram environment. Inside a typical two-story building which is equipped with photovoltaic (PV) panels and a battery bank. Each appliance has a realistic on/off schedule feeder according to its operating schedule in a typical house. For instance, light loads for first and second floor have different on/off schedules. A dynamic simulation software tool was used to model the appliances and obtain results of solar power generation at different tilt angles, heat generation and grid energy consumption. The purpose of the study was to monitor the battery bank's fractional state of charge at different load conditions and to determine the optimum tilt angle for yearly and monthly higher PV energy generation based upon Birmingham, AL weather. Eventually, this model will be used as the base model in order to effectively reduce the grid energy usage in presence of solar and other forms of renewable energy."
