## Abstract
"Nowadays, energy demand is a vital role in building sector, and almost 50% of energy is consumed for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system. The HVAC researchers, engineers and designers are strong-minded to focus on the development of energy-efficient system without conceding the comfort conditions. The aim of this study is to analyze the under-floor air distribution (UFAD) system by predicting indoor environment parameters and comfort condition of computational laboratory in an educational institution. The computational domain model is developed, which includes the seated occupants, personal computers with desk, ceiling lamps and supply diffusers. Numerical analysis to predict temperature distribution, velocity distribution, PMV-PPD and local thermal discomfort is carried out for two different cases of air change per hour (ACH) by using ANSYS FluentÂ®. Case A and Case B are considered with 15 ACH and 10 ACH, respectively. Results of the vertical temperature gradient are obtained from ankle (0.1 m) to head level (1.1 m) for the occupants in sitting position and is compared with the standards. Furthermore, the study provides the complete understanding of air movement in the room and also it signifies the importance of thermal comfort indices."
