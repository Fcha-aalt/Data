## Abstract
"With the growing importance of sustainability and environmental conservation, effectively managing visitor flows in high-rise buildings poses unique challenges and opportunities. Smart visitor management systems (SVMSs) offer innovative solutions to optimise resource allocation, minimise waste generation, and promote eco-friendly practices in this context. Through an in-depth analysis of relevant data, case studies, and expert perspectives, this study investigates the implementation and potential benefits of smart visitor management systems (SVMSs) in high-rise buildings, with a specific emphasis on sustainability. The findings reveal that the adoption of these systems can lead to significant positive impacts, including improved energy efficiency through intelligent lighting and HVAC controls, reduced carbon emissions by streamlining transportation and parking, enhanced waste management through digital registrations and real-time monitoring, and improved visitor experiences through streamlined check-ins and personalised services. Moreover, the integration of smart visitor management systems (SVMSs) enables high-rise buildings to achieve sustainability certifications and contribute to the overall environmental goals of Sri Lanka. The article also addresses the potential challenges and considerations associated with implementing these systems, such as data security and privacy concerns, initial investment costs, and the need for stakeholder collaboration. The insights derived from this study provide valuable guidance for building owners, facility managers, policymakers, and other stakeholders involved in sustainable practices in high-rise buildings in Sri Lanka and similar contexts."
