## Abstract
"A gray-box model overcomes the limitations of black-box building modeling. However, existing gray-box models have many parameters and calculate an optimized objective function from the data. We developed gray-box techniques for heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, and refrigeration (HVAC&R) equipment to understand the status of the system operation. The parameters of the individual equipment model are minimized and fitted for interval data by a machine learning model to automatically perform the calibration process. The power consumption of the individual models was approximately 14% higher than that of TRNSYS, and the power consumption of the entire system model was approximately 7% lower."
