## Abstract
"This paper describes a numerical testbed of a multiple-chiller plant for centralized HVAC systems, which was structured as a typical decoupled chiller plant, following those that are widely implemented in commercial buildings. The plant has a primary chilled water production loop and a secondary chilled water distribution system. A set of structure-open models were used, which enables the modification according to users' demands for their specific applications, such as to simulate the response of the HVAC system to the load variations, to estimate the energy performance of HAVC components, and to propagate uncertainties in operations, etc."
