## Abstract
"Simulation-based building performance allows detailed assessment of energy consumption in buildings, to analyze the energy performance. We can examine the influence of each factor extensively and systematically utilizing a dynamic energy simulation tool such as EnergyPlusÂ®, which allows flexibility of the energy model and variability of the construction elements, material properties, lights, HVAC system and occupants. The parametric model was developed according to the standards of designing office work spaces, accessories and communication. The parameters of user comfort are implemented from the weather data with the location: Belgrade, Serbia."
