## Abstract
"The requirement to have a quality indoor environment consumes a significant amount of energy. The proper design, selection and installation of a heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) system is important to have the efficient maintenance of a quality indoor environment. The selection of the variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system is one of the important options, as the VRF system is one of the most versatile HVAC systems. The operation of the VRF system depends on the indoor environmental requirements and the outdoor conditions. Hence, the VRF system is becoming widely applied to meet different indoor environment requirements and climatic conditions due to its robustness, flexibility, and energy efficiency."
