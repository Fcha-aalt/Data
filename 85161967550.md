## Abstract
"Energy management now forms a key part of airport sustainability policies and strategies. This study has used an in-depth longitudinal case study approach to examine Frankfurt Airport's sustainable energy management. The case study covered the period 2008 to 2019. The case study revealed that the airport's energy consumption displayed an upward trend from 2008 to 2016, and a general downward trend from 2017 to 2019. Throughout the study period, Frankfurt Airport introduced a range of energy efficiency related measures. These measures include the installation of high efficiency air conditioning, and ventilation (HVAC) systems in the airport's passenger terminal buildings, a reduction in lighting in the terminal building when they were not being used, turning off air conditioning systems at night, upgrading the energy efficiency of its passenger baggage conveyor system, the installation of more energy efficient light emitting diode (LED) lighting. The airport is also replacing its fleet of airport vehicles and aircraft ground handling equipment with electric powered vehicles. At Frankfurt Airport all new buildings are planned and designed for optimum energy usage. The airport's newly constructed passenger Terminal 3 has a range of energy efficiency measures, which include optimized cooling, the use of internal loads and dissipated heat from airport's baggage handling system to provide heat, LED lighting, as well as the intelligent use of daylight. The airport signed a power-purchase agreement for the supply of green electricity in 2020. Frankfurt Airport has also installed solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. The airport is also planning to use e-kerosene."
