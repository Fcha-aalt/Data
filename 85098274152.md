## Abstract
"Virtual battery (VB) is an innovative method to model flexibility of building loads and effectively coordinate them with other resources at a system level. Unlike a real battery with a dedicated power conversion system for charging control, methods are required for operating building loads to deviate from the baseline to respond to grid signals. This article presents a VB control for a commercial heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system to follow the desired power consumption in real-time by adjusting zonal airflow rates. The proposed method consists of two parts. At the system level, a mixed feedforward and feedback control is used to estimate the desired total airflow rate. At the zone level, two priority-based algorithms are then proposed to distribute the total airflow rate to individual zones. In particular, a zonal airflow limit estimation method is proposed using machine-learning techniques, in contrast to physics-based thermal models in existing studies, to more accurately capture zonal thermal dynamics and improve temperature control performance. An office building on the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory campus is implemented in EnergyPlus, and used to illustrate and validate the proposed control."
