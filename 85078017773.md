## Abstract
"Recent developments in hardware and software enable us to develop resource-aware and computationally efficient optimal control strategies, which are important for efficiently usage of energy resources. Event-based control is one of the energy-efficient methods especially for distributed and complex control systems. The prominent feature of the event-based control is the idea of removing unnecessary updating of control input when the system state stays in desired bounds. This paper focuses on the central idea of event-triggered and time-triggered control strategies for Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) applications. Furthermore, recent techniques on HVAC are classified concerning some prominent features. Thus, the present research provides an in-depth guide for designers who investigate the HVAC control application."
