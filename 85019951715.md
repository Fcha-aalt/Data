## Abstract
"This paper endeavors to apply a novel intelligent damping controller (NIDC) for the static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) to reduce the power fluctuations, voltage support and damping in a hybrid power multi-system. In this paper, we discuss the integration of an offshore wind farm (OWF) and a seashore wave power farm (SWPF) via a high-voltage, alternating current (HVAC) electric power transmission line that connects the STATCOM and the 12-bus hybrid power multi-system. The hybrid multi-system consists of a battery energy storage system (BESS) and a micro-Turbine generation (MTG). The proposed NIDC consists of a designed proportional-integral-derivative (PID) linear controller, an adaptive critic network and a proposed functional link-based novel recurrent fuzzy neural network (FLNRFNN). Test results show that the proposed controller can achieve better damping characteristics and effectively stabilize the network under unstable conditions."
