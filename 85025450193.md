## Abstract
"The objective of this study, including field investigations and simulations, is to evaluate the feasibility of retrofit for energy performance of a hospital in the midst of Taiwan. This hospital, twelve stories and two floors of basements, has 37490 m2 of gross floor area, consuming around 8500000 kWh annually. The current internal systems of this hospital present relevant signs of degradation and obsolescence. Concerning this matter, the retrofit plan of internal systems for this hospital is conducted to improve energy performance. Based on ASHRAE procedures for commercial building energy audits (PCBEA), field study and energy audits were conducted to collect information of building geometry, building materials, space types, density and activities of people, capacity of HVAC system, loads and operating schedules of lighting and internal equipment. Using this information, a hospital energy model with the current internal system arrangements is established using EnergyPlus software, calibrated by field information of this building as a baseline. The energy saving potentials of several energy saving measures applied such as high-performance chillers and lighting devices, window glass with tinted film and energy management resulting from EnergyPlus simulations have been examined with reference to the cooling energy demand. The retrofit feasibility has also been evaluated in terms of annual savings and pay-back period of the investment. Those analyses could be beneficial to establish a feasible retrofit plan for energy saving of this building."
