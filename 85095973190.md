## Abstract
"A virtual minienvironment cleanroom setup was developed using 3-D CFD simulations to evaluate the effect of supply airflow rates and HVAC design configuration on the airflow patterns and resulting distribution of particles in the cleanroom. The virtual setup included the minienvironmenat chamber with the worktable, a source of particle generation, and an operator in the room. A certain constant rate of particle generation was also assumed from the operator's gown.For the same HVAC configuration of the setup, the supply airflow rates were reduced to 50% while keeping the ratio of the supply airflow rate between the room and the minienvonment chamber constant. In the second analysis, the location of the supply air diffuser was moved directly above the operator to evaluate the impact on particle concentrations surrounding the operator. The analysis provided valuable insights regarding the airflow patterns of minienvironment cleanrooms. Also the analysis indicate that minienvironment cleanrooms may be operated at lower air change rates without significantly affecting the overall cleanliness level of the microenvironment chamber, provided the lower cleanliness levels in the surrounding cleanroom are acceptable. The location of supply diffusers has greater impact on the airflow patterns and on the resulting distribution of particles in the room than the supply airflow rates."
