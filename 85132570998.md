## Abstract
"This paper presents the application of a deep learning based model for the short-term forecasting of the electric demand in a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) for the demand response programs of utility companies. The deep learning model is applied through two different approaches comparing their merits. The approaches consist of: (i) a monolithic approach that applies a single large model to forecast the target variables, and (ii) a sequential approach that consists of multiple deep learning models coupled together each targeting a specific energy load within the HVAC system. The model accuracy of both approaches is explored over two case studies applied to the same institutional building; however, the case studies differ in their data source. The first case study uses synthetic data obtained from an eQuest simulation, while the second case study uses measurement data obtained from the building automation system. Results show that the difference in forecasting error of these approaches is negligible; however, the monolithic approach required the least amount of calibration time. Next, this paper explores the application of off-site weather data applied to a building model calibrated with on-site data. The experiments demonstrated that the off-site weather data can be applied with a slight reduction in forecasting performance."
