## Abstract
"This poster showcases the integration of building management system data with Wi-Fi derived occupancy data to calibrate a building energy model for energy performance prediction and analysis. Our results show an overall improved building energy savings and unmet hours by the Wi-Fi derived schedules compared to the baseline and at 4% occupied threshold, similar energy consumption as baseline is achieved but with reduced unmet hours."
