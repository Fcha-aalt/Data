## Abstract
"This paper presents a new laboratory set-up for the air-conditioningoperation analysis in the Laboratory for Automatic Control at the Facultyof Mechanical Engineering, University of Belgrade. The new HVAClaboratory is designed to investigate different complex HVAC systemworking regimes and to provide desired space comfort. The emphasis isspecially given to an impact on energy consumption. The laboratory set-upis designed to operate in the complex, dynamic regimes, when indoorenvironment parameters are intensively changed, together with a changeof outdoor conditions. In order to minimize energy consumption, a newsoftware and various automatic control algorithms are designed forautomatic control of the air handlig unit."
