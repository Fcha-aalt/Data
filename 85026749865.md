## Abstract
"Poor air quality is becoming a growing concern throughout the world as its long-term health and economic impacts are better understood. The World Health Organization considers indoor and outdoor air pollution the single largest environmental health risk increasing the possibility of developing lung and/or heart diseases as well as many other health conditions. Understanding precisely where this air pollution is happening and why, along with knowing optimal ways to finding measured and adequate solutions is essential to optimize air quality while saving energy. Air quality monitoring as an integral part of a connected grid can help optimize the use of HVAC systems to maintain air quality in a smart way, differentiating when and where action is really needed. The article explains how these different measurements and equipment can be coordinated to achieve both energy gains and better comfort and safety for people."
