## Abstract
"Energy efficiency and more effective management of maintenance processes in buildings is a critical aspect to modern facility management (FM). With advances in ICT, more informed decision making can be made available to maintenance engineers, in addition to more coordinated administration activities by facility managers. Using mobile technology, as a means to provide more effective communication with field crews, a complete building performance and maintenance system is required to support facility management platform."
