## Abstract
"An accurate prediction of indoor air temperature (IAT) for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in smart buildings is a challenging task, especially for a large future prediction horizon. In particular, the dependency of IAT modelling on various complex factors including outdoor ambient conditions, a large set of HVAC system parameters, and the nonlinearity which exists in building's thermodynamics make an accurate prediction of IAT difficult. Herein, we present a black-box model based IAT prediction algorithm which is used for an accurate IAT prediction using an artificial intelligence and a data-driven approach. Towards this, a Bi-LSTM (Long-short term memory) based model is proposed which is also compared with a standard LSTM based model. Our experimental results showed an improvement in IAT prediction of up to 10% using our proposed model when compared with a standard LSTM model for IAT prediction. These results are significant for applications where accurate IAT predictions can be used for a more robust energy consumption modelling and optimization in large scale buildings."
