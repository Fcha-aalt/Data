## Abstract
"An opportunity exits to reduce energy waste by improving the scheduling of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) based on occupancy. However, to enable this potential requires more accurate methods for predicting occupancy. This poster abstract motivates the use of multi-label classification (MLC) for predicting whether or not rooms are occupied based on data from motion sensors. Our implemented algorithms are benchmarked on a dataset from a commercial building in comparison to existing work. By presenting more accurate algorithms for occupancy prediction, we hope to foster the development of more energy-efficient HVAC scheduling systems to reduce overall energy consumption."
