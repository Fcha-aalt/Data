## Abstract
"The condenser is widely used in the field of HVAC&R, thermal energy and petrochemical engineering. The improvement of heat transfer efficiency can lead to the overall system energy efficiency increase, so the operating cost is reduced. This study focuses on condensation heat transfer process of R245fa with 4.38 mm horizontal tube. It is shown from test results that the changing rate of heat transfer coefficient for R245fa is normally same in the different condensation temperature. The peak of heat transfer coefficient exists with the quality increasing at the large mass flow condition. And heat transfer coefficient increases with quality increasing at small mass flow conditions. High efficiency of condenser can be designed by the experiment results. In addition, the enhancement of the heat transfer can also reduce the required heat transfer area. And consequently, the initial cost is decreasing."
