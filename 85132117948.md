## Abstract
"Thermal comfort is essential to maintain a stress-free environment in a building. This study investigated the thermal environment to develop a thermal comfort prediction model based on physiological signals and thermal comfort-related responses obtained from a wearable device. Field experiments conducted in an office during cooling and heating seasons enabled the collection of real-time thermal comfort responses and physiological signals, such as skin temperature, heart rate, and electrodermal activity of the occupant using the wearable device. We analyzed the relationships between the thermal comfort responses, physiological factors, and thermal environment to develop an accurate thermal comfort prediction model. While the skin temperature and electrodermal activity exhibited a significant relationship with the thermal state, a low heart rate was observed in a more comfortable state. Moreover, machine learning classifiers predicted the thermal comfort state achieved an accuracy of 80% in both seasons using only physiological data. Thus, the feature importance of the random forest classifier verified that physiological factors aid the prediction of thermal states significantly. The proposed prediction model can be potentially applied in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) control. The high performance confirmed the use of wearable devices in identifying the thermal status of building occupants."
