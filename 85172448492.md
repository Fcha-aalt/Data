## Abstract
"Maintaining indoor air quality (IAQ) through effective ventilation is essential for the well-being and productivity of building occupants. Control strategies aimed at improving the efficiency of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems must jointly determine ventilation and heating and cooling processes. In this paper, we study the problem of minimizing the energy consumption of the HVAC system in a multi-zone building, while meeting thermal comfort and IAQ requirements. We first perform a steady state analysis of the zonal carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and the temperature dynamics. The resulting expressions are convex in the zonal mass flow rates and zonal temperatures. Guided by the steady state solutions for meeting the thermal comfort constraints, we develop two control policies for improving the energy efficiency of building HVAC systems while jointly satisfying indoor temperature and IAQ constraints. We compare the performance of our proposed approaches with those of multiple baseline approaches which implement separate regimes for controlling zonal temperature and IAQ for a typical work-day in a multi-zone campus building. We have evaluated the performance of our proposed approaches under varying levels of flexibility in zonal temperatures. We have shown that zonal temperature flexibility can result in energy savings up to 32% (for the same control strategies) as compared to the case where no such flexibility is permitted. Our proposed approaches were seen to offer potential savings of nearly 29% compared to the baseline."
