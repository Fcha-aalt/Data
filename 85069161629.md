## Abstract
"Application of energy efficient chiller, compressor, air handling unit, evaporator etc are some indicators of the energy conservation in Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditiong (HVAC) systems. The condition of superheat vapor is the form of energy savings optimization in this paper. The present work aims to find the effect of various superheat temperature condition on an air cooled chiller simulation using refrigerant 22 numerically and experimentally. This investigation includes the analysis of the effect of degree of superheat toward the heat absorbed in coil of evaporator, heat rejected to the environment in condenser, power input in compressor and performance coefficient (COP) of the refrigeration system using numerical software and experimentally. The superheat temperature of refrigerant vapor in this experiment were between 4.6 to 7.6 degree Celcius. For given condition of superheat vapor, the working parameter of chiller are tabulated and investigated by comparing numerical and experimental data. The investigation reveals under 1% of COP of the system decrease to make sure the vapor which is enter the compressor is superheated vapor. The optimum condition of degree of superheat in the investigation were 5,05 degree Celcius."
