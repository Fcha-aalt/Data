## Abstract
"The document provides the presentation of the Kampa Building Innovation Center in Aalen/Germany. The 7-storey high-rise building is, for the time being, the purest timber building of this type in Germany. The complete loadbearing structure is constructed from massive timber (CLT, glulam) and also staircase-, elevator- and HVAC-shafts are made from CLT. Only the stairs and stair landings are concrete. The fire resistance is designed to 90 minutes. In addition, the building is extremely energy-efficient, equipped with photovoltaic, heat absorber walls, an ice-reservoir and effective heat exchange ventilation which leads to a Zero- to Plus-Energy Building. The building is equipped with innovative, prefabricated HVAC - ceiling-panels containing all heating, ventilation and lighting installations."
