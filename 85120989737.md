## Abstract
"This paper evaluates through experimental testing a prototype of switchable insulated shading (SIS) systems suitable for windows to optimize solar heat gains in order to maintain indoor thermal comfort. Specifically, the paper describes a laboratory testing procedure and measurement results for SHGC values specific to various SIS designs and operation settings using a box calorimeter set-up. The SIS prototype can modulate continuously its optical and thermal properties including U-value and SHGC using rotating insulation layers controlled through an actuator to a specific slate angle setting. The results of the experimental testing confirm that SHGC value for the SIS prototype is correlated to the slate angle of the insulated layers. This correlation remains applicable for any SIS insulation thickness. The measured data are used to assess the potential energy efficiency benefits from SIS when applied to windows for US homes. In particular, a prototypical housing unit located in three US cities is considered to evaluate the energy efficiency potential for switchable opaque insulated shading systems. The results indicate that SIS systems can achieve up to 8.3%, 11.3%, and 11.4% in annual HVAC energy consumption compared to no-shading cases for dwellings located in Golden, CO (representing a cold climate), Phoenix, AZ (representing a hot climate), and San Francisco, CA (representing a mild climate), respectively."
