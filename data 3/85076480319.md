## Abstract
"Integrated energy management across system level components in electric vehicles (EVs) is currently an under-exploredspace. Opportunity exists to mitigate energy consumption andextend usable range of EVs through optimal control strategieswhich exploit system dynamics via controls integration of vehicle subsystems. Additionally, information available in connectedvehicles like driver schedules, trip duration and ambient conditions can be leveraged to predict the operating conditions for avehicle when a validated model of the vehicle is known. In thisstudy, data-driven and physics-based models for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) are developed and utilizedalong with the vehicle dynamics and powertrain (VD&PT) models for a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). The integrated HVACand VD&PT models are then validated against real world data.Next, an integrated relationship between the internal combustion(IC) engine coolant and the cabin electric heater is establishedand used to promote potential energy savings in cabin heatingwhen the operating schedule is known. Finally, an optimizationstudy is conducted to establish a control strategy which maximizes the HVAC energy efficiency whilst maintaining occupantcomfort levels according to ASHRAE standards and improvingusable range of the vehicle relative to its baseline calibration."
