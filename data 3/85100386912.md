## Abstract
"With the growing demand for energy efficient HVAC systems and integration of renewable energy sources, existing energy transformers are being improved and new solutions are being sought. Various energy storage technologies are applied to solve unpredictable renewable energy flows. This paper investigates an innovative ventilation system with roof turbine ventilator and variable volume isobaric air tank, which is used to store an excessive wind energy. The study focuses mainly on isobaric air storage tank operation. The experimental results of the tank charging and discharging processes under different operation conditions are presented. These conditions include different weights placed on the top of the storage and air flow rates in the wind tunnel. The operation of the tank during one windy day in chosen location is studied. The obtained data showed the initial results of the operation of the developed ventilation system and possible modifications in order to improve its functionality."
