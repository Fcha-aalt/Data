## Abstract
"In India, as per the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) report for the year 2020-21, building sector contributes to 34% of total electricity consumption and is predicted to rise 3 fold by 2032. Energy consuming devices in commercial buildings includes lighting, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), and other auxiliary equipments. Lighting accounts for 20% to 40% of total energy consumption in buildings. Lighting control plays a major role in reducing the energy consumption. Most of the commercial wireless lighting control solutions available in the market use Radio Frequency (RF) for communication. Visible light communication (VLC) is an ecofriendly green optical wireless communication technology that combines illumination and communication thereby saves energy and reduces carbon footprint. This paper addresses the limitations of the existing RF based solutions and proposes an indoor lighting control solution using VLC for RF free zones."
