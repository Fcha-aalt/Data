## Abstract
"Control of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems (HVAC) has become an active area of research due to the significant energy expenditures and maintenance cost. Among the various controls of HVAC systems, chiller sequencing control is of great importance for multi-chiller plant to keep cooling reliability, system stability and energy efficiency. However, conventional chiller sequencing control usually lacks consideration of system stability and the accessional cost caused by the sequencing actions. Especially, those short-time or unnecessary sequencing actions become the main reason for operators to shut down automatic control. To enhance the reliability of chiller sequencing control, a robust hybrid predictive control is developed. This control is developed based on the typical total cooling load-based control and use an ARX prediction model to double check necessity of the sequencing actions. Case studies were carried out on a TRNSYS dynamic simulation with the configuration data from a real secondary school. Results showed that the switch number can be reduced more than 20% and operation cost can be reduced up to 4.25% without scarified in thermal comfort and energy efficiency."
