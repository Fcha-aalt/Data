## Abstract
"Obtaining reliable and detailed energy consumption information about building service (BS) systems is an essential prerequisite for identifying energy-saving potential and improving energy efficiency of a building. Therefore, in recent years, energy sub-metering systems have been widely implemented in public buildings in China. A majority of electrical systems and equipment can be directly metered. However, in actual sub-metering systems, the terminal units of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, such as fan coils, air handling units and so on, are often mixed with the lighting-plug circuit. This mismatch between theoretical sub-metering systems and actual electricity supply circuits constitutes a lot of challenges in BS system management and control optimization. This study proposed an indirect method to disaggregate the energy consumption of HVAC terminal units from mixed sub-metering data based on the CART algorithm. This method was demonstrated in two buildings in Shanghai. The case study results show that the weighted mean absolute percentage errors (WMAPE) are within 5% and 15% during working hours in the cooling and heating seasons, respectively."
