## Abstract
"The energy is used for construction, operation and demolition in the building sector is the most significant source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions which is predicted to affect the environment. Therefore, under the Paris Convention, this paper explores the current situations and the way forward for achieving zero carbon building (ZCB). Firstly, ZCB's are expected to decrease energy requirement via effective 'passive and active design solutions ', then secondly by means of renewable energy supply systems to meet remaining energy demand. The focus would be on the 'building envelope 'that involves the shape, orientation, and building elements which usually remain unchanged throughout their life cycle. Naturally, the HVAC system and any building-integrated energy supply are going to be an integral part of the design. All of these are going to significantly reduce the demand for energy and CO2 emissions, which are an optimized solution for a comfortable and healthy environment. In order to move forward, this paper encourages that ZCB principles should be explicitly determined within the need for computational modelling of buildings and their energy performance throughout the life-cycle of the building. Also, technical solutions may vary, but can be clarified around passive solutions and energy efficiency, on- and off-site renewable energy technologies, and carbon offsetting measures as these are explained in the case study."
