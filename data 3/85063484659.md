## Abstract
"Variable air volume (VAV) laboratory HVAC systems, including VAV fume hoods, are now standard practice and dramatically improve energy efficiency compared to the constant volume systems they replaced. To further improve efficiency, modern laboratory HVAC designs focus on two primary goals: minimizing the energy used to condition outdoor air and minimizing terminal unit reheat energy. In this regard, several guides and articles1–5 encourage using active chilled beams (ACB) in lab zones. But ACBs have many disadvantages both from a cost and efficiency perspective. This month’s column discusses an alternative design, 4-pipe VAV (4PVAV) systems, which cost less and are usually more efficient."
