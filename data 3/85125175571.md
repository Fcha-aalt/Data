## Abstract
"A data-driven MPC based energy optimization and management framework is proposed for an energy building. Specifically, the building energy management faces the challenges of multi-time-scale uncertainties such as operations of the energy equipment such as the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning unit and energy storage system. Based on the multi-time-scale energy system modeling, we formulate the two-stage MPC stochastic optimization problem including the large-time-scale scheme and real-time dispatch. The two-stage stochastic problem is then reformulated as a distributionally robust optimization problem, which is less conservative than the conventional robust optimization and doesn't require accurate uncertain distribution in stochastic programming. A delayed constraint generation algorithm is presented to solve the problem. A real-time dispatch optimization is further formulated for real-time energy management. The simulation results show the advantages of the proposed energy optimization and management framework in handling the multi-time-scale uncertainties and improving energy efficiency."
