## Abstract
"Efficient control of Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning systems can lead to great reduction in energy consumption. This can be achieved by new data-driven control algorithms based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this work Dynamic Simulation is coupled with a model-free RL algorithm to study its performance in terms of energy saving and thermal comfort in a realistic scenario. Two models are derived from the DOE Supermarket Reference Building for two climate locations. The simulations performed show a reduction between 5.4% and 9.4% in primary energy consumption for the two locations, guaranteeing the same thermal comfort of state-of-the-art controls."
