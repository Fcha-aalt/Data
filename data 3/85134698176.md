## Abstract
"Buildings consume a substantial energy to maintain thermal requirements for occupants, it's one of the factors that contribute to climate change. Recent scientific research suggests that merging phase change material (PCM) inside the architecture envelope can reduce cooling load. The current study looks on the capability of PCM to reduce building cooling requirement in hot desert climates. The paper methodology covers a detailed evaluation of thermal energy of an office site using Design builder, demonstrating how much energy can be saved by using PCM in the building envelope compared with nominal Egyptian building envelope. Leading to HVAC sizing capacity reduction around 13% and annual electrical consumption reduction around 6 MWh."
