## Abstract
"This paper proposes an adaptive controller based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), which copes with HVAC-systems consisting of slow thermodynamics. Two different RL algorithms with Q-Networks (QNs) are investigated. The HVAC-system is in this study an underfloor heating system. Underfloor heating is of great interest because it is very common in Scandinavia, but this research can be applied to a wide range of HVAC-systems, industrial processes and other control applications that are dominated by very slow dynamics. The environments consist of one, two, and four zones within a house in a simulation environment meaning that agents will be exposed to gradually more complex environments separated into test levels. The novelty of this paper is the incorporation of two different RL algorithms for industrial process control; a QN and a QN + Eligibility Trace (QN+ET). The reason for using eligibility trace is that an underfloor heating environment is dominated by slow dynamics and by using eligibility trace the agent can find correlations between the reward and actions taken in earlier iterations."
