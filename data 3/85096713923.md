## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 124 papers. The topics discussed include: simulation study on the impact of microgrids on DC arc; research on wavelet transformation for fault line selection of distribution network; detection and casing analysis of internal partial discharge for 35kV high voltage switchgear; design and simulation of adaptive internal model control algorithm; the application of ELCID on inter-laminar insulation failure of generator stator core; control of electric boiler with heat storage for the mitigation of wind curtailment; modeling and performance simulation of 100 mw solar thermal power plant; consumer engagement in virtual power plants through gamification; prediction of NOx in SCR inlet of thermal power plant based on mutual information and long short-term memory network; and research on demand response strategy of HVAC based on deep reinforcement learning."
