## Abstract
"This article outlines a method for conducting virtual energy audits in situations where on-site visits are not possible. The approach provides a systematic methodology, including utility cost analysis, facility energy balance analysis, and lean energy analysis, to identify and prioritize energy-saving measures. The critical areas examined during a virtual visit include the building envelope, lighting, and HVAC systems. The paper also includes a case study that highlights the efficacy of the proposed framework. The study recommends several energy-saving measures, such as consolidating electricity meters, using photosensors for sidewalk lights, replacing traditional bulbs with LED bulbs, and upgrading parking lot lights to LED bulbs. The article contributes significantly to the field of energy auditing, especially in cases where physical access to buildings is restricted. The proposed framework provides a cost-effective and efficient alternative to traditional energy audits and allows organizations to promote environmental sustainability by reducing energy consumption."
