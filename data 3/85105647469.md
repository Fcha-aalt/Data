## Abstract
"The issues of global warming and the greenhouse effect are of enormous concern today for most people. With increased demand for energy and a reduction in existing energy resources, demands for more energy efficient buildings within the construction industry are growing rapidly. Buildings are one of the largest energy consumers and account for about 40% of total energy consumption. This study aims to investigate the energy consumption of existing building located in Palembang as compared to the benchmark of Indonesian Standard for educational buildings. This paper also develops an energy analysis model with BIM integration to produce accurate predictions of the educational building performance with better scenarios. The EUI calculations were carried out in two ways. First, the electrical usage used in the building was calculated and then compared with the SNI 03-6196-2000 standard. Secondly, a 3D model was developed by redrawing the building object using BIM Revit application which follows the ASHRAE 90.1 benchmark standards. It was found that HVAC dominated for about 69% of the total energy consumption for the first floor, whereas electronic appliances contributed to the highest proportion of energy consumption, which was about 66%, for the second floor. The EUI value for the first floor was 22.43 kWh/m2/month, while the second floor was about 45.56 kWh/m2/month, resulting in an average EUI of around 33.99 kWh/m2/month. The existing building was then classified as a very inefficient building in terms of energy consumptions. Based on the renovation designs, 9 scenarios were then developed to measure potential energy savings generated by the building using the Insight 360 web-based energy analysis tool. In the last scenario, considering a building installed with solar panels with a time limit of 30 years, 90% of surface coverage resulted in an EUI value of -6.49 kWh/m2/year with 102.10% of energy efficiency. This building scenario could provide energy export and save the energy excess. It can also be concluded that there was a significant improvement on energy use reduction and a substantial increase in energy savings under different renovation design scenarios. Finally, the results will help the decision makers identify the potential for energy savings in all energy-consuming facilities and equipment in the building as well as develop strategies for energy conservation."
