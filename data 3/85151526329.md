## Abstract
"This paper presents an evaluation of the impact of changes in building HVAC system operation guidelines, aiming to reduce COVID-19 propagation, on building energy performance. Given the recentness and emergency nature of these responses, there is a gap in the literature addressing the energy performance impact of these new recommendations. Practical measures recommended by ASHRAE and REHVA are implemented in a computer simulation model of an existing building, created using the eQUEST program. Results show the increase of building EUI and operating cost mostly in the range of 20% to 60%. This increase is mainly due to additional: (a) space heating and cooling thermal loads, and (b) ventilation fans and pumps electricity consumption; caused by longer operation hours, increased ventilation rates and the implementation of humidity control. This research showcases the application of modelling tools in the support of public guidelines development, and it serves as an encouragement to consultants and researchers to explore methods for mitigating the impact and increasing feasibility of public health regulations."
