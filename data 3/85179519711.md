## Abstract
"The importance of dedicated outdoor air systems (DOAS) is widely acknowledged as properly designed and operated DOAS can ensure adequate indoor air quality (IAQ) in an energy-efficient way. Nonetheless, there is limited guidance in determining control sequences of operating the DOAS. In this regard, this paper aims to present an optimal supply air temperature (SAT) control strategy for DOAS. For this purpose, EnergyPlus-based primary school building models were developed under six different climate zones. Then, Genetic Algorithm (GA) was adopted to determine the optimal DOAS SAT control sequence that would minimize the energy cost of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system operation. Results show that approximately 1.3 % to 63.3 % of energy cost savings could be achieved, compared to conventional rule-based control (i.e., outdoor air temperature-based reset control). This study highlights that the optimal control allows energy-effective DOAS operations while guaranteeing sufficient ventilation and dehumidification."
