## Abstract
"Many buildings around the world utilize Efficient HVAC systems to provide the thermal comfort conditions for the occupants and users of these buildings as well as providing adequate conditions for special environmentally sensitive equipment. The appropriate air conditioning systems that are energy efficient and environmentally clean would necessarily cost more than those inferior systems. Capital cost, operating and maintenance costs are influential factors in the proper selection of equipment. The appropriate air conditioning system design would necessarily provide the comfort and hygiene conditions with as low as possible initial capital and operating cost. The present study provides comprehensive analyses and comparisons between the water-cooled vs. air-cooled chillers with packaged roof top air-cooled systems under the local Egyptian climatic conditions, primary water and energy prices and legistilations. The capital cost consists of the equipment and installation costs. The present study presents a comparison among the various systems according to the equipment and installation costs. The operating costs considered here would comprise the energy bill cost, and water consumption cost. Finally the maintenance cost would be considered for the equipment lifetime span, spare parts cost estimation, and sudden breakdown repair costs estimation. Objectives of the present study are summarized as follows: • Solicit the most economic system for each category of building applications. • Derive indicative energy indices in terms of kW/tons refrigeration, COP and EER • The priority selection of various systems for commercial buildings of various sizes and applications. • Device a methodology to relate operating costs to total energy cost with life cycle cost analyses. • The simulation cases include the effects of cooling load, functionality, and building size… to ultimately suggest; the best system for energy saving; best system for saving capital cost; best system for saving the operating cost and best system with lower specific energy cost saving. The final section in this investigation introduces the results of the comparisons obtained under several bases and will end with the conclusions and recommendations."
