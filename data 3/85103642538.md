## Abstract
"As efficient control of HVAC systems becomes a focus in research on building energy efficiency, the limits of building simulation software in this respect are reached quite soon. Co-Simulation of building envelope, HVAC systems and controls in the respective tools of the different fields allows for easy collaboration between experts from the different domains, and therefore is a promising approach. In this paper, the coupling of TRNSYS and SIMULINK using a co-simulation framework based on the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) specification is demonstrated and discussed with the help of an example from the IEA SHC Task 44."
