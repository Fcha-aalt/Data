## Abstract
"Analyzing the economic status in KSA in recent years, especially the investment sector, a major increase in the residential buildings sector is noted. This growth led to a massive energy consumption that was disproportionate to the Saudi’s growth in power generation. It is also worth noting that the residential sector accounts for 42.3% of the total energy consumed in KSA where the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) is considered one of the key factors in energy waste. Meanwhile, the architects who design those buildings usually don't pay enough attention to the energy in the design process. This paper will tackle a strategy for the environmental control of building designs which is the insulation especially with the high technology in material manufacturing that led to many new materials that are developed with nano-technology, it is vital to take into consideration buildings’ energy efficiency and the building compatibility with the environment by improving the design of the building envelope elements such as building shell. This research sheds light on the feasibility and profitability of nano-technology insulation materials’ implementation and associating it with the thermal and environmental quality of the envelope of the building. The current building energy and HVAC performance in Al Riyadh City, one of the largest cities in KSA, was measured using a computer-based simulation tool (Design-Builder). Toward the end of the research, a conclusion about some of the aspects of the building envelope will be reached like thermal insulators’ implementation into the construction layers of any building shell element seeking to minimize the energy waste in the case study and improve the indoor environmental quality, in addition to the various criteria of residential buildings’ designing process in KSA in the near future."
