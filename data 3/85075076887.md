## Abstract
"Improving control systems in buildings and HVAC systems is one of the roads toward better energy efficiency in such applications. It is often problematic to define the model in complex and nonlinear systems such as buildings and HVAC systems, while accurate and simple model of the system is important condition for efficient control. Resistance- Capacitance networks are recognized as useful and flexible tool for developing such models, but have disadvantages in unclear and long procedure and possibility of errors due to large number of variables and parameters. This paper proposes an algorithm that enables semi-automated design of white-box or grey-box models of buildings, based on layout and used materials, resulting in shorter time and less errors during development of model. Model is implemented and then tested on real building, first as white-box model with initial parameters and later as grey-box model with parameters estimated from data."
