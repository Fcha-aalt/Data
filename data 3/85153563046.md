## Abstract
"Energy conservation is a practice of reducing the energy used, which may be achieved by efficient use of energy. The existing old buildings generally consume more energy than the new buildings because of their unavoidable stagnations in physical performances. Distribution side load management of buildings play a vital role in the field of energy management. And 30% of this distribution side loads are Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) loads. So the accurate estimation of heating load (HL) and cooling load (CL) of HVAC system in a building is very much important. It has been studied that the building design parameters optimization approach alone can provide up to 62.1% electrical energy consumption reduction compared to buildings that are not designed for efficient energy usage. Recent research has demonstrated that a combination of existing HVAC technologies can offer effective solutions for energy conservation and thermal comfort. So in this study various energy saving strategies for HVAC systems are investigated and different measures on further energy and cost savings in buildings are discussed."
