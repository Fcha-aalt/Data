## Abstract
"The heat exchanger can use shallow geothermal energy to provide regional heating and cooling demand in winter and summer. In this paper, a large-scale public building is taken as the example, and the energy system in the building is taken as the research object. Firstly, through the collection of geothermal drilling geographic information and geothermal data, the geothermal reserves and geothermal recoverable resources are evaluated. Secondly, the cooling and heating demand of the building is calculated by using HVAC simulation software. Then, the heat transfer capacity of a single pile is evaluated and the lay-out scheme of the underground heat exchange pile foundation of the building is given. The actual heating effect of the heat exchange pile foundation system is explored, and the heat transfer characteristics of heat exchange pile foundation under different working conditions are compared and analyzed. Finally, reasonable suggestions for the arrangement of heat exchange pile foundation are given."
