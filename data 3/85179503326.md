## Abstract
"Design cooling load calculated by traditional design day (TDD) is overestimated, which makes the capacity of the air-conditioning (AC) system oversized. It leads to high energy consumption and low energy efficiency. Coincident design day (CDD) is applied to accurately calculate the design cooling load. In this study, the air conditioning systems in Hong Kong, Changsha, and Beijing are designed using the peak cooling load calculated by CDD and TDD The cooling energy consumption was simulated by DesignBuilder and compared for different AC systems. The results showed that the VRV system designed by CDD had an energy-saving rate of 1.09%~9.05% in a single-side external wall room. For the whole building, the FCU+DOAS, CAV, and VAV systems designed by CDD had energy-saving rates of 11.19%~13.27%, 13.99%-21.43%, and 13.42%~18.38%, respectively. The results indicated that using CDD for HVAC system design can significantly reduce energy consumption in different climate zones, thus having great potential for energy savings."
