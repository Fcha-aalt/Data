## Abstract
"Improving the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system to minimize heating and ventilation consumption in large networks of controlled buildings has become a necessity nowadays. This attempt requires the development of a sophisticated machine learning (ML) model capable of properly predicting energy usage trends. This research focuses on the problem of predicting energy usage in a group of public buildings. Three unique models are used in the study: artificial neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and autoregressive neural networks. Given that the public sector consumes a significant portion of total consumption, accurately anticipating this usage becomes crucial in reaching energy conservation targets. We used data from an energy usage monitoring system placed in a business building in France for our experiment and we employ the aforementioned methodology, which depends on tree-based methodologies. We use measures such as RMSE, MSE, MAE, and R2 to analyze the performance of each technique. Our findings show promise in terms of accurately estimating energy use. In addition, we discovered the possibility of energy savings in one of the scenarios."
