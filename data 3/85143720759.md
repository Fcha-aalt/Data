## Abstract
"Simple and fast dynamic model for the prediction of PV self-consumption. The widespread use of renewable energy plays a crucial role in increasing the energy efficiency of the building stock. The significantly decreased PV system prices and the high flexibility in electricity use for all loads in a building, i.e., space heating (and cooling) and domestic hot water in combination with heat pumps, auxiliary energies, household appliances, and also increasingly electric mobility leads to a wide use of PV. However, the integration of PV into the building is complex and requires the use of electrical and/or thermal energy storage and appropriate control strategies. Therefore, evaluating and optimizing the part of PV electricity that is used directly or stored in the building is a challenging task. Thus, for a detailed analysis of PV and energy storage at the building level, extensive building and system simulations were performed using reference buildings."
