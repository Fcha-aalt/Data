## Abstract
"In Morocco, the building sector is one of the most energy intensive sectors; it accounts for about 25 % of energy consumption. A large part of this consumption is reserved to Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems, especially in some particular areas. The aim of The Moroccan energy efficiency strategy is to save 12 % of energy consumption by 2020. With this in mind, action plans for energy efficiency were implemented in all key sectors such as buildings. This paper aims to evaluate the thermal performance of an office building intermittently occupied. Simulations are performed by TRNSYS software and a Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) is considered for Tangier, Ifrane and Er- rachidia cities representing significantly different climates. This investigation indicates the importance of some passive energy efficiency measures that have a potential of saving up to 59% of the annual loads under Tangier climate, up to 25 % for Ifrane and up to 61 % for Er-rachidia depending on the building construction scenario."
