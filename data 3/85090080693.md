## Abstract
"Buildings energy efficiency is highly dependent on occupants’ energy and environmental lifestyle. In this view, this work aims at identifying the potential benefits of human-based energy retrofit strategies, namely human behaviour triggering actions and associated energy awareness, through large-scale surveys and calibrated building dynamic simulation. In detail, a questionnaire is submitted to office occupants to understand workers’ energy behaviours, indoor environmental perception, and identify tailored triggering actions. Therefore, different occupant behaviour scenarios involving energy wasteful and efficient human-building interactions are modelled when implemented in a case study office building in Italy. Findings show that the elimination of energy wasteful behaviours may involve building energy need reduction up to 17%. Furthermore, triggers aimed at driving energy efficient human control of HVAC setting and natural ventilation provide further annual performance improvement. Therefore, motivating occupants to change behaviour is a challenge to reduce energy consumption while improving indoor environmental conditions and cost-energy benefits."
