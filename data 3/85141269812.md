## Abstract
"In recent years, there is an increasing demand for ZEH equivalent houses as an initiative for housing to cope with global warming and decarbonization in Japan, which become increasingly intense and embodied. Under such circumstances, this article considers Next Generation ZEH based on the use cases related to HEMS and data driven control using locally predictable and correctable Meteo data on Outer Skin, Openings, HVAC, Lighting, Hot Water Supply etc as a smart system which responds to the reduction of primary energy consumption by energy generation, saving and storage and the measures against complex natural disasters in terms of architectural and MEP approaches."
