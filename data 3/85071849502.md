## Abstract
"Our paper is referring to a commercial building having a good thermal insulation, compacted shape with three basements, from which two are for parking and technical areas in the underground, and the other floors are mainly for retail, technical rooms, offices and a terrace for walking and events. The methodology used in our building thermal zones modelling analysis is including: all used measured areas within the building; all materials related to the building envelope with high thermal efficiency values; all activities performed within the respective areas; the heating and cooling activities for each zone; the lighting and controls used for each zone; the building geometry related to the data requirements, loads, air conditioning and lighting systems areas; the building usage schedules; Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) and electrical system specifications along the weather data. The building thermal zones modelling simulation was performed based on the air set point temperature, ventilation fresh air rate and the room destination. After monitoring the building along four operational years, the energy consumptions for heating and cooling systems were obtained for each thermal zone and for the entire building. Some technical measures to improve the building energy performances are proposed based on the monitoring period."
