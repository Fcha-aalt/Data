## Abstract
"Heating ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems consume a substantial volume of energy within corporate buildings, mainly due to lack of severe monitoring which results in compromising either energy efficiency or user comfort. We propose a simple HVAC control system that automates the HVAC operation in real time by considering energy management policies and user preferences. Our system is built on top of IoT (Internet of Things) framework, where appliances in a laboratory are automated with suitable sensors also thermal parameters are obtained from sensors and user feedback information are collected for real-time processing in our distributed cloud environment. We utilized Blynk Application Programming Interface (API) to monitor the real time data from sensors, to obtain user feedback periodically and to dynamically adjust the temperature settings based on energy management policies, user feedback and sensor values. The effectiveness of HVAC is evaluated mathematically. Our experiments indicate that we achieve total saving of 0.9 kWhr and also maintain user thermal comfort consistently."
