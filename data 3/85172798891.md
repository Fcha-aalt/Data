## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 324 papers. The special focus in this conference is on International Conference on Building Energy and Environment. The topics include: Evaluating Design Options for Healthy Lighting in Apartment Housing Units Considering LEED, WELL, and Toronto Green Standard; a Data-Driven Frequency Domain System Identification Approach to Define House Archetypes and Flexibility; baseline Estimation of Heating Consumption for Different House Archetypes Through a Data-Driven Clustering Methodology; evaluate the Energy Saving from Window Opening Behavior Through Coupling a Deep Learning Model with EnergyPlus; Exploring the Feasibility of an Integrated HVAC System in the U.S.; low-Energy Wearable Cooling Strategy for Thermal Comfort at a Warm Environment; deep Reinforcement Learning Based Smart Water Heater Control for Reducing Electricity Consumption and Carbon Emission; deep Learning Models for Future Occupancy Prediction in Residential Buildings; A Case Study on Inter-Building Occupancy Using GIS-Based Movement Data on Campus; investigation on the Thermal Performance of Halloysite Nanotubes-Based Solid-Solid Phase Change Materials in Floor Heating System; economic Assessment of Bidirectional Low-Temperature District Energy Systems with Seasonal Energy Storage and Photovoltaic Thermal Hybrid Solar System; Assessing RBFMOpt and HypEâ€™s Performance Based on the Number of Fitness Functions; a Simulation Tool for Renewable Energy Supported Buildings; Greenhouse Gas Analysis of Solar Adsorption and Typical Residential HVAC Systems for Major Cities Across Canada; thermal Assessment of the Varennes Library Building-Integrated Photovoltaic Rooftop System; application of Novel Methods to Compare the Flexibility of Residential Space Heating Systems; assessment of Plant-Based Oils as Low Carbon Phase Change Materials for Building Applications."
