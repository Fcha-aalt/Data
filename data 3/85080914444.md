## Abstract
"More than half of the commercial building stock in the United States was built before 1980 prior to the increased focus on energy efficiency. In the current age of Smart and Green buildings, owners incorporating expensive sensor infrastructure to reduce building energy consumption and improve the building occupantsï¿½ satisfaction, efficiency, and comfort levels. The success of these automated building systems is influenced by the ability to estimate building occupancy. Recently, researchers shifted their focus towards exploring different occupancy estimation techniques with both dedicated sensors and existing infrastructure (e.g. CO2 sensors, Smart meters, temperature and humidity sensors, and wi-fi networks). However, there are concerns about the cost effectiveness, computational effort, accuracy and privacy protection for these techniques. This study explores the usage wi-fi router data to generate the of number of IP addresses connected to the router to estimate the occupancy within a building. To this end, occupancy patterns in a thirty-year-old university building are estimated using existing wi-fi infrastructure and compared and calibrated to ground data obtained manually and from dedicated occupancy estimating sensors to evaluate the accuracy. The estimated occupancy data patterns using existing wi-fi network represent a cost-effective method of occupancy estimation with less computational processing and reduced privacy concerns, that could assist owners in the decision-making process towards investing into smart and energy efficient technologies."
