## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 44 papers. The topics discussed include: deepfakes for histopathology images: myth or reality?; multi-modal data analysis and fusion for robust object detection in 2D/3D sensing; deep learning semantic segmentation for high-resolution medical volumes; adaptive data generation and bidirectional mapping for polyp images; tamper-proofing imagery from distributed sensors using learned blockchain consensus; a cell augmentation tool for blood smear analysis; methods of exploiting multispectral imagery for the monitoring of illicit coca fields; real-time traffic management system using object detection based signal logic; evaluation of different decision fusion mechanisms for robust moving object detection; and occupancy detection for smart HVAC efficiency in building energy: a deep learning neural network framework using thermal imagery."
