## Abstract
"With escalation in adoption of the technology for smart homes and smart building, it becomes absolutely necessary to devise an energy efficient ecosystem. This requirement for energy efficient system is based on the statistics released by The Statistics Portal. This report results into tightening the environmental regulations and increased concern about climate change among the public. As a result, energy efficient solution has been recognized as a high priority international goal in order to improve sustainability of the planet. In order to achieve the goal, governing bodies across the world are taking conscious and sincere efforts. For example, The U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s Building Technologies Office (BTO) has set a target of 20% energy use reduction in commercial buildings. Here, authors attempt to understand the basic architecture of IoT ecosystems and its adaptation for providing an energy efficient architecture. Smart homes and buildings have been considered to simulate IoT ecosystems throughout the chapter."
