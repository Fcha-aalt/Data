## Abstract
"In this project, a 3D-printed, cost-effective caged drone was designed, manufactured and programmed such that it can move through industrial-sized HVAC ducts by rolling and hovering motion, and can switch between remote-control and autonomous navigation to detect thermal leaks and blockages. The 3D-printed cylindrical cage enables the rolling motion of the drone through straight ducts simply by pitching the drone forward, thus it provides an energy-efficient alternative to continuous hovering, prolongs operation time and protects the drone and the operators. The drone is equipped with both IR and ultrasound proximity sensors for navigation and crack detection, an RGB camera to record a video feed of the drone's expedition through the duct, a temperature sensor and thermal camera to detect thermal leaks."
