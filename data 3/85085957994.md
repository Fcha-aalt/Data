## Abstract
"Heritage buildings represent the cultural identity of our countries. However, as time advances, they may require some intervention in response to new user needs. Raising energy-efficiency of this buildings is challenging, as interventions should not devaluate the building's aesthetics. In Alexandria city, Egypt, a large number of heritage buildings exists and is still in use. Although new interventions are usually applied, the issue of raising energy performance of these buildings is rarely considered. This study aims at exploring the potential techniques of raising energy-efficiency of heritage buildings in Alexandria. A case study was selected; the Commercial Chamber of Alexandria, which was completed in 1935 and listed in the Alexandrian book of Heritage. It was recently renovated, a new floor added and a central HVAC system installed. A virtual model was created for the building using Design Builder tool to perform energy simulation. Existing building materials and current occupancy, lighting, HVAC and equipment schedules were applied. The software was validated by comparing simulation results to actual monthly average energy consumption of five years (2011:2015). Then, a number of scenarios of interventions were investigated for their effect on energy consumption. Results were analyzed, compared and the best performance scenarios were highlighted."
