## Abstract
"This paper presents a novel approach to design a decentralized economic model predictive control (eMPC) strategy for an HVAC system in a multi-zone building. The primary source of coupling between interconnected zones is the shared walls of which a direct temperature measurement is either not available or difficult to obtain. To circumvent this issue, we design a full order nonlinear state-observer to estimate the walls temperatures of zones using which the system is decomposed into control-oriented thermal models of individual zones. Subsequently, a decentralized eMPC is designed whose economic performance, in fact, turns out to be the same as that of a centralized control strategy. As a result, the control signal is now computed faster for a longer prediction horizon, thereby, makes the proposed eMPC scheme suitable for the real-time implementation. The effectiveness of the proposed control approach is demonstrated on a one floor, three-zone building constructed using SIMulation of Building and Devices (SIMBAD) toolbox."
