## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 56 papers. The topics discussed include: virtual storage plant aggregating electrical energy storages and HVAC systems providing regulating reserve and voltage regulation; predictive control co-design for enhancing flexibility in residential housing with battery degradation; deep learning explicit differentiable predictive control laws for buildings; transient performance of tube-based robust economic model predictive control; feedback-optimizing model predictive control for constrained linear systems; zero-order robust nonlinear model predictive control with ellipsoidal uncertainty sets; and reducing the computational effort of min-max model predictive control with regional feedback laws."
