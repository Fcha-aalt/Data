## Abstract
"In the ever-evolving vibrant landscape of our times, it is crucial that a peaceful environment is ensured taking into account all the likely ecological parameters along with humidity and temperature while conserving energy. Thus, besides mechanical and electric control systems, it has become vital to ensure that artificial intelligence (AI) is assimilated and deployed into the systems so as to raise the well-being of the environment. By disseminating intelligence across the building by utilizing the new internet of things (IoT) technology, along with control formats, local open standard data, AI algorithms, and cloud-based predictive analytics, the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) mechanism renders the capability to acclimatize to use patterns, alterations in use patterns, and equipment breakdown. By tracing human activity coupled with analysis of noise, energy, and temperature in the building, its occupants and facility managers can obtain vital insights for planning, optimum use of space, and behavioral changes, in turn ensuring more content and safer inhabitants and considerably more efficient structures. Moreover, fuzzy modeling shows its applicability factor with the execution of human rationale and reasoning with if-then rules as attained from the system's input-output info for model setup and training. Additionally, it presents advantages pertaining to predictive functions for tackling nonlinearity and uncertainty as well as studying the capability of the models recommended. Thus, the multi-dimensional model recommended in this study outlines a system architecture as an implementation methodology and how it harmonizes prevailing systems while offering comprehensive knowledge to HVAC systems for the accomplishment of lower energy consumption and inhabitant safety and well-being on the basis of the fuzzy modeling. With tolerance for CO2 discharges moving towards zero, the recommended multi-dimensional model provides substantial advantages for the HVAC sector for meeting the essential objectives while taking into account enhanced sustainability in vibrant and nonlinear environments for enhancing the accuracy and fairness of the assessment outcomes."
