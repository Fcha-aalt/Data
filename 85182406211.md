## Abstract
"An ultra-high accuracy energy meter was fitted into an existing 25 Tons working air conditioner and the readings were collected 24/7 over a period of one month. Then, those readings were analyzed and incorporated into a thermodynamic parametric study to find the best model and approach of conserving the wasted energy using Variable Speed Drives (VSDs) technology. The goal is to optimize the electrical consumption of the air conditioner. Thus, resulting in reduced losses, size, and cost that are associated with a typical solar PV system installation, yet it was very crucial to take care of the mechanical constrains to avoid any issue with the refrigeration cycle that might cause damage or reduce the overall lifetime of the equipment like a frozen coil, oil leaks, or a mechanical wear and tear problem. The introduced approach provides a very good amount of energy that can be conserved before even introducing a solar PV system."
