## Abstract
"In school buildings, the relationship between energy requirements and occupant thermal-hygrometric comfort plays an important role because these buildings are great energy consumers also as the current rules impose large rates of ventilation outside air for classrooms. The goal of this paper is the thermal and energetic comparison of various air-conditioning systems that are appropriate for school buildings. Among the different suitable HVAC systems for schools, the following types are considered: All-Air system (with constant air volume and heat recovery) and zone heating coils; radiant heating floor panels and primary air; fan-coils and primary air. The analyses are performed on a designed new school building, by means of a dynamic building energy simulation software (Design Builder), based on Energy Plus engine. The simulations are conducted to obtain the trends of various internal environmental parameters for both winter and summer, i.e.Temperature, relative humidity and PMV (Predicted Mean Value) index in one classroom. In cooling and heating conditions, the HVAC systems are active, while in the intermediate seasons only mechanical ventilation is working. This study evaluates the performances of different HVAC systems from an energy, thermal comfort and economic point of view. The analyses are conducted for Rome, characterized by Mediterranean climate."
