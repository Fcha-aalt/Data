## Abstract
"The building information modeling (BIM) method is one of the newest methods that has been widely used in many parts of the building business, including energy management. The aim of this research is to analyze the most holy theotokos in order to find the best set of modifications that result in an optimal energy cost. The analysis was conducted through the use of building information modeling (BIM) technology and the associated programmers such as Auto Desk Revit 2020 and Auto Desk Insight 360, in order to determine the optimal strategies by which the most applicable alternative construction materials and procedures are considered in order to obtain an environmentally and economically sustainable most holy theotokos. Applying this analyze to the most holy theotokos revealed that many alternatives are capable of making a tangible reduction in the cost of electrical energy consumption and the cost of fuel for generators. Such reductions are noticed when altering in the optimum manner. The alteration of construction materials for walls and roofs also reduces the cost of electrical energy consumption and fuel for generators. The results show that changing the plug load efficiency in the optimal manner reduces the cost of electrical energy consumption by approximately 933913 US dollar ($), and changing the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning systems (HVAC) reduces the cost of fuel energy consumption by approximately 13522 US Dollar ($). Green building studio (GBS) is a tool that helps in the early stages of a project to find the best ways to save energy."
