## Abstract
"The amount of energy consumed by a building can be estimated by performing dynamic simulations. In this study, two building simulation energy software, EnergyPlus, and TRACE700 were used to assess the energy performance of an existing service building. The building, placed in a specific zone of Portugal, has thirty people and a floor area of 2,000 m2. It consumes mainly electricity, natural gas, and solar energy. The dynamic simulation started with the weather file upload, and then the construction, illumination, interior equipment, and HVAC systems were defined. The results were compared with the actual energy consumption values, and the deviation was 2% in the case of EnergyPlus and 0.5% in the case of TRACE700."
