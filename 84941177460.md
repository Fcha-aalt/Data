## Abstract
"Tomorrow's consumers likely will have the ability to monitor their appliance-specific energy usage, remotely program their HVAC system, live in more energy-efficient dwellings, obtain electricity through rooftop solar photovoltaic systems, drive plug-in electric vehicles, and have a generally higher level of knowledge about household energy usage. How will they respond to electricity price signals? The authors explored this question through pricing experiments at the Mueller neighborhood in Austin where, to some degree, 'the future is now.'."
