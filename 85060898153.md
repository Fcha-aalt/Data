## Abstract
"This paper presents a smart thermostat based on ISO7730 standard's thermal comfort model-PMV-PPD model for improving energy efficiency and saving energy. In the smart thermostat, the desirable comfort level (PPD) set by consumers determines the ON/OFF state of the air-conditioner and the control signal is the predicted mean vote (PMV), which is calculated with indoor temperature, human factors and other climate index for precisely estimating people's comfort level. Besides, the potential of applying demand response is discussed theoretically by installing the purposed smart thermostats as a remote controller in order to shave the aggregate peak load of BVAC systems. Finally, a second-order Equivalent Thermal Parameter (ETP) model is applied to simulate 1000 residents in MATLAB/Simulink to test this method. The results have shown that by installing the smart thermostats, energy saving is up to 11.5%."
