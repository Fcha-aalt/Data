## Abstract
"We proposed a system that adds a 1 m3 TES tank called simple TES on the bypass pipe of the existing HVAC system, and it can charge/discharge within short-term less than an hour instead of a day. By simulation, it is found that the simple TES can improve energy efficiency of HVAC system because of increasing the partial load ratio of the heat-source equipment reduces its energy consumption and reducing operation time of the primary chilled water pumps, and then it can be achieved reduction of the energy consumption by 30% compared to conventional system."
