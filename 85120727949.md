## Abstract
"In warm climate zones, especially those affected by the heatwaves produced by climatic change, high indoor temperatures in residential buildings can cause health problems to the residents living there. One potential solution consists of implementing Heat Ventilation Air Conditioning (HVAC), but it comes with multiple negative consequences such as CO2 emissions and high building utilization costs. Another possible solution of reducing the heatwaves effects is to increase the building's thermal mass, but in doing so, the seismic mass and the structural loading will also end up increasing. Therefore, for regions that are both warm and seismical, the energetic design of light-frame timber buildings usually opposes its seismic design, making it hard and far from trivial to reach an optimal design considering structural and thermal energy performance. Even though there are several studies available in the literature about multicriteria energetic-structural optimization methodologies for timber buildings, to the best of the authors' knowledge, these multicriteria optimization have not addressed the complicated trade-off between overheating and seismic design of light-frame multi-story timber buildings. This research proposes a design methodology that incorporates structural and energetic behavior in a timber building through a Genetic Optimization Algorithm (GOA). A structural model implemented in Matlab has been coupled with an energy model developed in Grasshopper/HoneyBee/EnergyPlus, whereas GenOpt optimized the coupling process itself. The proposed optimization algorithm has been applied in a real multi-storey timber building, which has been selected as a case study. The results show a reduction in energy consumption of 27,17% when compared to its base value, as well as keeping feasible structural design. It is concluded that current optimization tools are available for coupling structural and non-structural behaviour of realistic multi-storey timber buildings, which should enhance their competitivity in the construction industry. Future works shall be further testing the versatility of the optimization model, including wider variability in element properties, location of the study case, lateral connectors and anchorage systems. It is expected that this extended study will provide important insights in enhancing the design of light-frame multi-storey timber buildings for regions prone to earthquakes and overheating."
