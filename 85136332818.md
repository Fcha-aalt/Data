## Abstract
"As a practice, energy conservation entails minimising the amount of energy used, which can be done through utilising energy more effectively. And because of this increasing demand of energy in day to day life, energy conservation has been an important challenge in today's life. So a better management of energy usage in buildings is very much essential. As in Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system, heating load (HL) and cooling load (CL) are counted as a main part of loads in buildings, the accurate estimation of these loads of a building is very much important. It involves the accurate analysis of energy consumption and the different aspects of enhancing the energy efficiency in buildings. As we know that the artificial neural networks (ANN) can perform more efficiently than the linear programs. So, in this paper A feed forward network is being used for performance analysis of HL and CL of a domestic building by considering eight input variables. As a result, the mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), and mean relative error (MRE) for HL and CL are respectively 0.1248, 0.1686, and 0.0611 for HL and 0.0087, respectively for CL."
