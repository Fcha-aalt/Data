## Abstract
"In the last years the HVAC sector has seen the growing interest in using the so-called multi-source heat pump systems. This type of plant aims to improve the energy performance of the heat pump. As widely known the heat pump represents the most promise solution in terms of potential for exploitation of renewable energies. The sun and air can be used as alternative sources to the ground during the middle season or when they are available and convenient, while the ground could be used during the peak periods of the seasons keeping good energy performances of the system. The present work summarizes the monitoring results of a large-scale experimental plant used for the air conditioning of a 100 m2 snack bar in Ferrara, Italy. The energy behaviour of the plant has been monitored for one year and its performance has been compared with the existing plant. The results have proved an energy saving between 20 % and 70 % in cooling mode. In heating the proposed plant is less competitive due to the share of renewable energy considered in the existing heating system. The work shows how these systems are potentially suitable for the electrification and decarbonisation process in the building sector."
