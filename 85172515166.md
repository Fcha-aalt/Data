## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 105 papers. The topics discussed include: the use of plasmonic metal nanoparticles to enhance the efficiency of thin-film silicon (Si) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) solar cells - a comparative study; assessment of equity of feed-in tariff in Japan; energy and environmental implications of green house gas mitigation policies in the transport sector of Sri Lanka; the use of inclined tuyer and its effect on the compatibility of downdraft gasifier fed by rice husk and wood sawdust; automatic sun tracking for the enhancement of efficiency of solar energy system; occupant-based HVAC set point interventions for energy savings in buildings; one hour ahead short-term electricity price forecasting using ANN algorithms; benchmarking energy efficiency in tropical data centers - metrics and measurements; and effects of increasing power electronics on system stability: results from MIGRATE questionnaire."
