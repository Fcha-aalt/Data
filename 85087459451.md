## Abstract
"The paper shares the design of the self-sustaining energy efficient 90 Sq. m eco-responsive solar regions with the use of innovative systems having the combination of the active and passive strategies. The project named BAITYKOOL prototype was designed, constructed, assembled and tested as a competition entry for the Solar Decathlon Middle East (SDME 2018). The house works as a biological eco system developed to suit the culture and climate condition of the region. The comfort conditions of the habitat and the house performance has been enhanced with development of the innovative systems - the compact composite house envelop works effectively to enhance the comfort conditions within the house with reduced cooling load and lighting system worked with control mechanisms for the ambient light quality as suiting to the user based on the activity. A smart water management system with a monitoring system to optimize the use of water has been implemented. This adds value to every drop of water used being filtered by the Lumbrifilter and an UV treatment system being used for the aquaponic system that crystallizes the biodiversity. The HVAC system takes advantage of the night sky acting as a heat with the radiative sky cooling system. The energy requirements of the house has been met by the solar panels used in the prototype integrated architecturally on the roof as dynamic pergolas and on the wall as vertical panels maintain the energy balance. The biomimetic solar cells mounted on the glass panels generates higher energy and maintains an energy balance. The prototype exhibits the innovative systems and its strategies taken in design, construction technique, technology used and its operations to have an eco-responsive solution developed for a healthy living and working suited to the extreme warm climate of the region."
