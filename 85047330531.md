## Abstract
"The application of convective heat transfer for air mass displacement in ventilation systems without the mechanical draft (integration of Double Skin Facade with HVAC Systems of the building) has a real practical perspective for Building energy performance. The purpose of this article is development of the theory of heat and mass transfer in capillary-porous media, air flows and building structures. The engineering purpose is a concept development of a closed ventilating circuit with convective heat flow to reduce the pressure on the environment, improve the comfort of the building and reduce operating costs. The subject of this research is a closed ventilating circuit with convective heat flow in constructive energy system (ventilated facade integrated with the HVAC system). It was the mathematical modeling of convective heat flow in ventilated facades. Based on the results obtained the concept of a closed ventilating circuit with convective heat flow is developed. The proposed system uses Convective heat transfer in a ventilated facade for the ejection and injection facilities, heat recovery in the buffer zone of the fa√ßade. It allows reducing ecological pressure on the environment and the application of energy resources."
