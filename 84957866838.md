## Abstract
"A total performance oriented optimization and retrofit (TPOR) approach is applied to evaluate the energy performance and implement the energy efficiency measures (EEMs) in a high-tech campus located in northern California, climate zone 2, with a total building area of 31,000 m2. Those EEMs identified include system optimization and retrofit on the HVAC equipment serving the office, lab and clean room area. The building energy savings were validated ac-cording to International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) utilizing the whole building energy consumption. The annual electricity usage was reduced by 3,853,625 kWh (122 kWh/m2) with a total annual energy cost savings of $304,436 (blended utility rate of $0.079/kWh). The overall simple payback was 1.6 years after incentives from the utility company. TPOR is proved to be an effective approach that can lead to a) lower costs, b) reduced project timelines, c) improved project decision making, and d) increased energy savings."
