## Abstract
"The paper describes the development of a hybrid solution that improves air dehumidification. It comprises the integration of a composite desiccant and a nano-woven membrane for air dehumidifcation. The solution compliments any building HVAC project where the removing moisture from the air via an energy-efficient means is a concern. Longer sustainable performance of the desiccant is achieved as the non-regenerative membrane assists in partial air dehumidification. Accordingly, the hybrid system requires a lower regenerating temperature while producing air of very low humidity. In sum, the proposed hybrid solution involves the composite desiccant and membrane to work hand-in-hand in order to achieve enhanced moisture removal efficiency and improved energy efficiency by up to 40% compared to the best grade commercial silica-gel desiccant."
