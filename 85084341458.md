## Abstract
"Nowadays it is possible to obtain almost real-Time measurement data using various IoT solutions, which can be used in order to control building management systems like heating, ventilation, cooling equipment (chiller), lighting. Nevertheless there are limited number of solutions allowing to control it by using hourly data (like electrical power consumption, room temperatures, humidity, CO2 levels, heat energy, ventilation system pressures, outdoor climate data). This paper deals with 6R2C mathematical model development, that uses real-Time data obtained from IoT sensors, practical measurements and experimental testing results achieved during summer period, when the cooling energy is needed. Measurements and experiments were conducted for certain building zone, which is PN4 ventilation zone for the most electrical energy consuming HVAC system of the building, located also in the south side and having most impact by the sun radiation. Using simplified modeling and input data approach, CV(RMSE) estimation of the model for daily consumption for the period from 8 August to 8 September resulted in a value of 28.62%. In monthly period average energy consumption error (single month) is 0.14%."
