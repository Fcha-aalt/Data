## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 761 papers. The topics discussed include: building and evaluation of cloud storage and datasets services on AI and HPC converged infrastructure; toward quantifying vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure systems; causal maps for multi-document summarization; action recognition using dynamic mode decomposition for temporal representation; requirements engineering practices and challenges in the context of big data software development projects: early insights from a case study; methodology for interpretable reinforcement learning model for HVAC energy control; hotkey-LSM: a hotness-aware LSM-tree for big data storage; general self-aware information extraction from labels of biological collections; responsible AI: a primer for the legal community; EPIC30M: an epidemics corpus of over 30 million relevant tweets; extensible data skipping; ExNav: an interactive big data exploration framework for big unstructured data; and sequence matching with discriminative binary features for robust and fast light-rail localization at high frame rate."
