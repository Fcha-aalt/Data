## Abstract
"In the framework of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, we are wondering to find new strategies for the Energy optimization that leads to identify designs and technologies that minimize the energy use and maximizing energy savings. That is why the development of very efficient services and technologies in terms of energy is very crucial. Biomimetics, as an optimization approach offers us a great potential for Energy Efficiency. In this paper, we propose a useful bio-key tool based on biomimetic principles to find new methods and systems for renewable energy in hot and arid regions. This methodology is relevant to various disciplines as a problem solver to optimize the energy use; this is due to the generality of the strategy tools."
