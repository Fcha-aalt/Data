## Abstract
"Increasing the building renovation rate is a key initiative to drive energy efficiency in the sector and contribute to the European Green Deal. Within this paper, the BIM-based building renovation decision support system RenoDSS is described. RenoDSS (i) automatically generates renovation scenarios based on user preferences and the IFC representation (including second level space boundaries data) of the current building configuration (baseline), (ii) calculates baseline and renovation scenario KPIs, and (iii) identifies the most suitable scenarios by comparing the scenarios’ energy, finance, and sustainability KPIs. Validation conducted at two pilot sites shows that RenoDSS reduces the time for (i) identifying potential renovation scenarios, (ii) calculating their energy and LCA/LCC KPIs, and (iii) producing an IFC file for each renovation scenario by around 80% compared to tool-supported manual means. RenoDSS is used by (i) renovation designers that want to optimize the thermal building hull in combination with PV, solar thermal, and HVAC, as well as (ii) decision makers who want to collaboratively identify the most promising renovation option out of the ones generated by RenoDSS."
