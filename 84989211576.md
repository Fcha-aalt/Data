## Abstract
"Real-time optimization (RTO) has been developed to improve the cost and/or energy efficiency of complex heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. In current literature, almost all of the developed real-time optimization methods belong to the type of time-driven optimization, in which the action of optimization is triggered by “time”. As optimization should be done when the system operating conditions experience a change that is large enough to cause current operational setting not optimal any more, optimization strategies should recognize ‘significant’ changes and perform optimization when necessary. Since the time-driven optimization is a periodic mechanism in nature while those ‘significant’ changes may not be periodic, the time-driven optimization cannot capture ‘significant’ changes and do the optimization promptly. Therefore, this paper proposes an event-driven optimization (EDO) for complex HVAC systems, the key idea of which is to use “event” rather than “time” to trigger the action of optimization. A systematic event-driven optimization method is illustrated, where its main tasks, including event definition and event identification, will be discussed. The proposed method will be compared with a conventional time-driven method using case studies, through which the main advantages of the proposed method will be identified."
