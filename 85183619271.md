## Abstract
"This paper discusses the adoption of a special Reinforcement Learning approach, namely the Actor-Critic (AC) one, to the temperature control of medium-size buildings. In particular, the approach here proposed is a predictive AC, in the sense that the AC algorithm is coupled not directly with the plant to be controlled, but with a predictor, thus enforcing a predictive behavior of the decision-making part of the AC. The reward function is defined on a prediction horizon, with 3 different formulas, as well as 3 different ways to compute the control action based on the predicted behavior. A real test case is considered and a comparison with a nonlinear MPC previously developed is given. Results are definitely encouraging in that predictive AC control reaches a similar performance as nonlinear MPC, without the need of realtime optimization."
