## Abstract
"Energy Efficiency is becoming a world-wide concern and attracting increasing interest in both industry and academia. A smart building is at the cornerstone of energy-efficiency as it represents the main constituent in a smart micro-grid. To promote energy-efficiency in buildings, an Energy Management System (EMSs) that controls HVAC appliances is indispensable. Based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, an EMS needs to handle data acquisition, data analysis, and acting. In this paper, we present a real-world EMS deployed in a real-world building. We used wireless sensors, along with microcontrollers, to implement the networking component that connects data readers, actuators, and the control plane where the database lies. To test our platform, we sense rooms' temperature and react upon corresponding heaters. The presented solution is promoted for a wide deployment covering a whole university campus."
