## Abstract
"The modern smart building offers software solution and sensing the surrounding environment. However, this will be allowed management easily for leaders that are providing better control and optimize heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) ØŒas well as this is consider from the important topics in mechanical engineering modern application. In this paper, a new intelligent HVAC system is proposed for modern smart building. The proposed system is heavily based on one of the most efficient tools of artificial intelligence which is a support vector machine. This technique will be depended on the data set to detect the HVAC system for any building. In this case, it will save time as well as it has the ability to provide a suitable system without any delay. The HVAC system that proposed in this paper is very important issues in design modern building. According to for training and testing phases for the proposed system, we can easily notice efficiency and effectiveness for the cooling and heating systems."
