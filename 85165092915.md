## Abstract
"Machine learning models have emerged as a viable method to predict plant water requirements with the ability to form non-linear correlations between plant response variations and microclimate conditions. An artificial neural network is used in this work to predict irrigation water requirements in a greenhouse located in a hyper-arid region with high solar radiation and encompassing an HVAC cooling system and CO2 enrichment. The prediction model is developed from direct gas exchange measurements of transpiration and takes as input parameters microclimate data including greenhouse solar radiation, temperature, humidity and CO2 concentration along with hyperspectral imaging-based vegetation indices. Results demonstrate the high performance of the data-driven artificial neural network (ANN) model with microclimate and vegetation index (VI) features. The ANN model resulted in a comparatively higher performance than the FAO56 Penman Monteith empirical model and linear regression with an R2 of 91.2%, RMSE and MAE of 0.0648 mm/h 0.0528 mm/h respectively. The proposed data-driven predictive model will enable the determination of irrigation water supply in greenhouses under CO2 enrichment and with varying microclimatic conditions, and support the implementation of precision irrigation."
