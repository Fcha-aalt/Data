## Abstract
"Cooling systems for HVAC applications in aviation area have a great importance and due to the limited space in complex aviation systems and equipment, energy efficiency is becoming increasingly importance. Energy efficiency affects the design of chillers that account for a significant ratio of the energy consumption in plants. Legal legislations in the short-term limit, and in the long term prohibit the use of refrigerants that have high global warming potential, which are very harmful to the ozone layer. Since air-cooled condensers are among the essential components of cooling groups, efforts to improve their energy efficiency are made incessantly, the related national and international standards are upgraded and limitations on their energy consumptions are always increasing. In light of the latest applicable standards, detailed and comparative information on applications aimed at improving the energy efficiency in air-cooled condensers, highlighting the importance of energy efficiency in cooling installations."
