## Abstract
"Climate has a great impact on the thermal performance of buildings. This study aims to provide a theoretical foundation for developing climate classification for building energy-saving in China. The current thermal climate zoning mothed was evaluated by using the mean deviation to assess its applicability on guiding building energy-saving design in China by using the latest weather data measured from 1988 to 2017. The analysis results indicate that current thermal climate zones cannot present the difference in atmospheric moisture and solar radiation in different regions. The current cold zone is unable to reveal the discrepancy of the monthly average temperature of hottest month in different regions. To provide an adequate guidance for the energy efficient design of HVAC systems as well as for passive building design, the main zoning criteria should be revised and the climate indices relating to air humidity and solar radiation should be considered in the future."
