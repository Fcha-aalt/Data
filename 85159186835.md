## Abstract
"Water-based cooling is often the most energy efficient to use when cooling by cold ventilation air for occupancy and indoor air quality does not cover heat gains in office space. This can be done efficiently by using 4-way active chilled beams with an integrated variable air volume function. The designs of this system were studied by full-scale test office room setups. Heat gains of simulated office room cases varied between 46-66 W/m2floor and cool ventilation airflow rate between 1.8-3.2 l/s, m2floor. 4-way chilled beam systems with 600x600 mm units or with 1200x600 mm units with designs of one or two units were tested. Measurements were conducted with calibrated air velocity and temperature sensors. The thermal environment was similar in low heat load situations in the symmetrical 4-way chilled beam cases when compared with the earlier studied active ceiling diffuser case. When the heat load level increased, velocity levels increased. Differences in thermal environment between two 4-way chilled beam designs were small. Non-symmetric one 1200x600 design generated the worst conditions. More units allow better flexibility for indoor climate adjustment."
