## Abstract
"The Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Procedure described in ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2013, Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality, is an alternative performance-based method for determining minimum outdoor air ventilation rates. However, due to perceived deficiencies in methodology and application, the IAQ Procedure has been an \"on-again, off-again\" HVAC design approach. Due to increasing momentum for more sustainable, greener building design with the concurrent demands for increased energy efficiency and IAQ, there is renewed interest in this method. Properly applied, the IAQ Procedure can provide for considerable HVAC-related energy savings along with significant improvements to IAQ. This paper provides an update on current activities related to the IAQ Procedure with regard to Standard 62.1; ASHRAE TRG4.IAQP for development of the Indoor Air Quality Procedure; U.S. Green Building Council LEED pilot credit EQpc68, and case studies describing successful application of the IAQ Procedure in a LEED building project. Additional information will be provided describing practical applications of the IAQ Procedure along with examples that illustrate capital, HVAC equipment, and system renovation savings as well as energy savings possible by employing the IAQ Procedure."
