## Abstract
"Indoor climate and lighting in office buildings are operated using static and conservative setpoints and schedules that are sub-optimal for real occupancy/occupants’ diverse preferences. In contrast, occupant-centric control (OCC) is an operational strategy whereby occupancy/occupants’ preferences are estimated to improve energy efficiency and comfort. This paper develops a practical workflow for implementing and evaluating OCCs via building simulation. A library of five OCC functions is introduced for use with building sensor data. EnergyPlus simulations of a generic nine-office testbed are performed with combinations of OCCs, climates, and envelope assemblies to demonstrate the workflow; the results showed that the energy use and thermal discomfort (the number of hours spent outside a selected thermal comfort zone) could be reduced by up to 37% and 65%, respectively, when OCCs were implemented in the testbed. This workflow allows for a diverse combination of OCCs, climates, and envelopes that can be expanded upon practically and incrementally."
