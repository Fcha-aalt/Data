## Abstract
"The (ANFIS) adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system based Renewable energy system (RES) of an LF-HVAC linked hybrid system is described and evaluated in this research. It depicts main sources of energy such as wind turbines (WTs) that transport electricity through LFAC transmission lines. To connect to a central DC bus, all the sources of energy utilize dc to dc power converters. The paower that must be transferred is determined by an ANFIS-based despotic control system, which takes into consideration the power requested by the load. In addition, the 3-phase inverter that connects the hybrid system of LF-HVAC to loads is controlled via ANFIS. The Renewable Energy sources have been integrated with Low-frequency transmission lines to observe the stability of the Grid. Further Dynamic simulations show that the ANFIS-based RES is suitable for the hybrid system under investigation and that it outperforms the traditional RES. All the simulations and works were performed in 30 KW Wind energy using Matlab Simulator."
