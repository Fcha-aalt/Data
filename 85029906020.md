## Abstract
"The provision of an appropriate shelter was the basic premise of human habitats from remote times, aimed at providing indoor comfort conditions and protection from the external environmental conditions. The role the building envelope plays is essential to achieve this objective. This work investigated the thermal performance of three different experimental modules (EM) with a solar control system (SCS) and different envelope characteristics relative to a control module (CM). The results showed that the EM with the SCS and the rammed earth walls presented the best thermal performance relative to the CM. It is expected that the results can be applied in low cost housing of various regions of the country for providing thermal comfort conditions of the occupants and to reduce the electricity consumption for the use of air conditioning systems (HVAC), and eventually, to diminish the burning and emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) to the environment."
