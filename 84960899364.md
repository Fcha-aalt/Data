## Abstract
"In this paper the energy design and the optimization of a non-residential NZEB conceived for Mediterranean climates are discussed. The presented NZEB will be built up in Naples (South-Italy). The building will include offices, expo spaces and a conference room. Different innovative energy efficiency strategies, regarding the building envelope and plants are taken into account. Their benefit in terms of energy performance is assessed by a novel in-house developed building energy performance simulationcode (DETECt 2.2) written in MatLab. An optimization procedure and a sensitivity analysis of the pivotal design and operating parameters are carried out from both the energy and economic points of view. The obtained numerical results show that interesting energy and economic savings can be achieved. Results can be useful for stakeholders working on non-residential NZEBs in temperate climates."
