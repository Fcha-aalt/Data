## Abstract
"Intelligent and automated fault detection and diagnosis (IAFDD) of heating ventilation air conditioning (HVAC) systems is one important technique in the development process of construction 4.0. Data-driven IAFDD adopts various rules analyzing sensor data collected by the Internet of things (IoT) system for detecting and diagnosing potential faults for facilities. A rule-based system, named, a three-layer diagnostic Bayesian network (DBN) is developed in this study. A set of maintainability rules have been identified through an interview and survey process, supplementing the development of the DBN. The outcome of this study concretizes the development and implementation of the diagnostic Bayesian network for HVAC IAFDD."
