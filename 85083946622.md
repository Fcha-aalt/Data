## Abstract
"Modern low-energy buildings use a mixture of conventional (gas, oil, electricity) and renewable energy-sources (geothermal, sun collectors) to heat or cool the building and to provide domestic hot water. The complexity of these systems increases the difficulties to analyse their efficiency and to evaluate building's performance. This paper introduces a simple and scalable model-based virtual sensor that allows analysing a buildings' energy consumption down to room level using only a minimal set of sensor information. The approach is demonstrated for a case study of the Environmental Research Institute (ERI) building that uses such a hybrid HVAC system."
