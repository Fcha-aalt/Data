## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 25 papers. The topics discussed include: acceleration-based human activity recognition of packaging tasks using motif-guided attention networks; MRIM: enabling mixed-resolution imaging for low-power pervasive vision tasks; fine-grained stop-move detection in UWB-based trajectories; weight separation for memory-efficient and accurate deep multitask learning; context-driven encrypted multimedia traffic classification on mobile devices; effect of user expectation on mobile app privacy: a field study; HVAC power conservation through reverse auctions and machine learning; and adversarial deep feature extraction network for user independent human activity recognition."
