## Abstract
"In the pursuit of improved energy efficiency, older and new buildings are being fitted with Building Energy Management System (BEMS). BEMS can be used to extract valuable building data that can be subsequently analysed to discover problems related to user comfort, building maintenance and energy wastage in buildings. The main focus of this paper is to demonstrate an effective method to remotely analyse and categorise the different Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) Terminal Unit (TU) behaviours using BEMS data. Using a data-driven, unsupervised learning strategy to identify anomalous behaviours enabling notifications to the building manager regarding faulty TUs can go a long way in providing energy savings and improving building performance. A novel feature extraction method based on event discovery from TU data is proposed and applied to multidimensional data streams retrieved from a building based in the city of London. Further, X-means clustering has been performed over the extracted features to group the different TU behaviours. The clustering results, validated through established statistical methods, successfully yield several distinct TU behaviour patterns in addition to the outliers. The clustering behaviour has been further verified across daily and weekly TUs."
