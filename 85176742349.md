## Abstract
"Indoor environment quality control is very important for building operations as occupant of buildings spend up to 90% of their time indoors. After Covid-19 pandemic break out, indoor environment quality has become even more crucial to the society because of health concerns. Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) covers conditions such as air quality, lighting, thermal conditions, ergonomics inside a building and their effects on the occupant or occupants of the building. Thermal conditions and air quality are usually achieved with the mechanical or natural ventilation systems or by HVAC equipment. As buildings became more complex structures, different airflow distribution systems to be developed to fulfill such requirements. For this purpose, not only the airflow distribution systems need to be modified but also diffusers that provide which supplies/draws air to/from systems are to be improved. Detailed analysis of these subcomponents is needed to assure that such devices provide high levels of comfort effectiveness and energy efficiency. The objective of this study is to develop a comprehensive analysis for air characterization and indoor air regime of different diffusers (square diffuser, operable flap diffuser) and their effect on comfort level of occupants Fanger’s model of thermal comfort is used with CFD simulations and a tool is considered for the validation experiments. Using more than 16 thermal sensors including one on a mannequin head, on a table and at foot level, the readings were correlated by using anemometers to measure air flow at supply diffuser and at different operating levels. CFD simulations were according to different scenarios which are to provide a comparison between diffusers and understand indoor airflow regimes. The results considering the flow interaction between diffusers and surroundings showed a detailed visual illustration in CFD simulations and their relation to perceived comfort levels."
