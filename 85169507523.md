## Abstract
"This open access book systematically summarizes the current research progress of attachment ventilation, covering vertical wall attachment, column attachment, and adaptive attachment ventilation. Attachment ventilation is a high-performance ventilation mode that was first proposed by the author, Prof. Angui Li 20 years ago. Now it has been widely used in office spaces, subway stations, high-speed railway stations, international airport terminals, and other large spaces. This book introduces attachment ventilation in detail to eliminate the cooling/heating load of the occupied zone and provide an expected environment for the air-conditioned zone. Attachment ventilation combines the advantages of traditional mixed ventilation and displacement ventilation. This book consists of six chapters, covering a series of airflow patterns, mechanisms, parameter correlations, and attachment ventilation design methods. It is helpful for HVAC engineers to design attachment ventilation effectively."
