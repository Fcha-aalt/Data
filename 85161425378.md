## Abstract
"Traditional tactics are not a feasible option for smart buildings’ more advanced features, such as predictive and adaptive control systems. The ideas of smart buildings and socially resilient cities, in which building automation technologies are used to regulate and control energy generation, consumption, and storage, have been presented. As a contribution to a building’s efficiency enhancement, we built a strategy that will help regulators adopt better policies for new construction based on the level of efficiency. After choosing a reliable dataset and getting it ready to use, a decision tree (DT) model was trained to predict the heating load (HL) and cooling load (CL) of a new building based on its structural design and features. The evaluation of the model revealed an accuracy of 99.6% for HL predictions and 95.6% for CL predictions. In an improvement scenario, we discussed a possible energy savings of 179 GWh after using this strategy to approve a typical number of buildings (100 buildings)."
