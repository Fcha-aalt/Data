## Abstract
"The Liyuan building is a typical example of the modern traditional residential buildings in Qingdao. It has the enclosed architectural form and unique historical style, and its unique architectural form causes the contradiction of natural ventilation of buildings. Based on the climate characteristics and energy conservation and emission reduction targets of Qingdao, taking Jieshuli as an example, the natural ventilation in the current transitional season of Jieshuli was simulated by VENT software, and the crux of the problem was analyzed and passive ventilation design was carried out for the building. However, it is necessary to add mechanical ventilation because of the limitations of passive ventilation design in the courtyard. The following paper will explore the mixed ventilation mode in which natural ventilation and HAVC act together in the transition season. By calculating the HVAC load of each space in the building, the optimal ventilation demand and the theoretical value of ventilation times are obtained, and the mixed ventilation strategy with relatively low energy consumption and high energy efficiency is obtained."
