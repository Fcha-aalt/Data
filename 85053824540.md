## Abstract
"The building energy consumption in China accounts for 27.5% of the total energy consumption. How to make an effective optimization management of building energy consumption is a key issue for the energy saving. In this paper, based on the mathematical formulation for the building energy consumption optimization in paper[1], it adds the formaldehyde content as one of the performance indexes, Then, this paper proposed an effective Lagrangian relaxation iterative algorithm, improves the optimal efficiency and the response speed for the problem. According to the mathematical models and optimization algorithm, a green three-star green building with ultra-low energy consumption is used as the energy consumption optimization management background, and the high efficiency Lagrangian iterative optimization algorithm is applied to the problem of building energy consumption optimization management, and verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in the optimization of building energy consumption management and the improvement of solving quality."
