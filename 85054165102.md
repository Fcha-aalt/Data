## Abstract
"The Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system of commercial buildings traditionally runs on a fixed schedule that does not take occupancy into account despite its huge variation over space and time, thereby wasting a lot of energy in conditioning empty or partially-occupied spaces. Occupancy information is essential to eliminate wasteful energy use with imperceptible impact on building operations and human comfort. This paper investigates the application of non-intrusive techniques to obtain a rough estimate of occupancy from coarse-grained measurements of sensors that are commonly available through the building management system. Various static and adaptive energy-efficient schedules are developed based on this approximate knowledge of occupancy at the level of individual zones. Our experiments in three large commercial buildings confirm that the proposed techniques can uncover the recurring occupancy pattern of the zones, and schedules that incorporate these occupancy patterns can achieve more than 38% reduction in reheat energy consumption while maintaining indoor thermal comfort."
