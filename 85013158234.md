## Abstract
"Energy contributes the most important part of our universe. Energy as a fuel is essential for the economic development in any nation. Thus, it is required to increase the efficiency of utilization of electrical energy and in order to expand the availability of these resources fuels make the use of renewable energy sources. The premier objective of this survey is to analyze the control performance of various currently used energy efficient building techniques. In this paper an attempt have been made to discuss the techniques that focuses on heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems (HVAC systems) of building, where cooling and heating rely on centralized chilled water and hot water generation respectively. This paper deals with such control techniques whose incorporation would certainly enhance the future direction in energy efficient buildings."
