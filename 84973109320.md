## Abstract
"Building energy efficiency has increasing focus worldwide. The heating, ventilation, air-conditioning (HVAC) devices account for highest energy consumption in buildings in Singapore. Multipoint sensing information in the various scenario is critical to optimize the HVAC operation, and increase the energy efficiency of the air-conditioning. A software called FloVENTÂ® is used for simulation of room models in different scenario. It calculates the temperature, airflow speed, pressure and other parameters in the mathematical way, providing the solutions for the models. The first experiment is done to find the effect of the multipoint sensing system due to the moving heat source. A testing heat source, represented by 11 visitors, is located in 5 different positions for the sensitivity test of the monitors. Another experiment simulates the dynamic situation of visitors coming in and leaving the room. The experiment results are analyzed for identifying the most sensitive sensor and the most optimal sensing point. The parameters of temperature change from the most optimal monitor can be used in the control system for improving the energy efficiency of the motors."
