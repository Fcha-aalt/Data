## Abstract
"Recently, it is predicted that internal heat gain reduced because the efficiency of OA equipment is will be become high and the consciousness of energy saving is increasing. And it is effected on reducing of internal heat gain on HVAC system and indoor thermal environment. For example, operating efficiency of HVAC system will be exacerbated by increasing partial load operating. So, this study makes survey of internal heat gain. To circumstantiate change of energy consumption and offer fundamental information about internal heat gain. In this study, effect of air-conditioning load influenced by change of internal heat gain was investigated."
