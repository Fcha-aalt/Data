## Abstract
"The features provide the required comfort multizone buildings by using the power management multiagent system and comforts. This management system covers all controlled areas of the building and, if necessary, ensures the highest possible overall comfort in a building with a decrease in available electric power. The aim of this work is to develop a comfort control system multispectral building."
