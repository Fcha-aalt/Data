## Abstract
"This study presents the efforts of creating a plan to improvise current energy saving approach in the hospital. Although there could be many technical methods which might improve energy efficiency, hospital managers and energy auditors should consider simpler measures at first. However there are various measures hospital has already taken such as replacing CFL lights to LEDs and many more but efforts need to be more concentrated and converged towards a motto. Hospitalâ€™s energy policy need to be seen in genuine terms as far as voluntary participation of staff is concerned. Studies suggests that HVAC, medical equipment and lighting account for 50-60% of energy consumption in a hospital."
