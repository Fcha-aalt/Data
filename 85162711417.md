## Abstract
"Thermal systems are essential features of all domestic and industrial applications involving heat and fluid flow. Focusing on the design of thermal systems, this book bridges the gap between the theories of thermal science and design of practical thermal systems. Further, it discusses thermodynamic design principles, mathematical and CFD tools that will enable students as well as professional engineers to quickly analyze and design practical thermal systems. The major emphasis is on practical problems related to contemporary energy- and environment-related thermal systems including discussions on computational fluid dynamics used in thermal system design. Features • Exclusive book integrating thermal sciences and computational approaches • Covers both philosophical concepts related to systems and design, to numerical methods, to design of specific systems, to computational fluid dynamics strategies • Focuses on solving complex real-world thermal system design problems instead of just designing a single component or simple systems • Introduces usage of statistics and machine learning methods to optimize the system • Includes sample PYTHON codes, exercise problems, special projects This book is aimed at senior undergraduate/graduate students and industry professionals in mechanical engineering, thermo-fluids, HVAC, energy engineering, power engineering, chemical engineering, nuclear engineering."
