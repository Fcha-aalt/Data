## Abstract
"Optimal control of building's HVAC (Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning) system as a demand response may not only reduce energy cost in buildings, but also reduce energy production in grid, stabilize energy grid and promote smart grid. In this paper, we describe a model predictive control (MPC) framework that optimally determines control profiles of the HVAC system as demand response. A Nonlinear Autoregressive Neural Network (NARNET) is used to model the thermal behavior of the building zone and to simulate various HVAC control strategies. The optimal control problem is formulated as a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) problem and it is used to compute the optimal control profile that minimizes the total energy costs of powering HVAC system considering dynamic demand response signal, on-site energy storage system and energy generation system while satisfying thermal comfort of building occupants within the physical limitation of HVAC equipment, on-site energy storage and generation systems."
