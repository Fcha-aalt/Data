## Abstract
"The aim of this study is to compare and validate a building energy simulation model of a university building with monitored data. In addition, different building services engineering concepts are compared with each other regarding their ecological life cycle-based performance using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methods. Optimizing these performances regarding sustainability indicators plays an essential role in realizing a climate-neutral building stock. A university building from the 90s, which consists of almost 900 thermal zones, is used as a case study. Detailed heating consumption data are available for the inspected building and are compared to the simulation results. Different energy supply concepts are first subjected to conducting LCA and then to a detailed energy performance simulation. This paper presents a procedure that enables decision-makers to examine building services engineering issues and to derive conclusions in a time-saving manner regarding appropriate sustainable actions. The focus on sustainable energy supply systems is an essential milestone for the realization of climate-neutral building stocks. The scientific innovation is in the detailed reproduction of the existing building and the comparison between simulation data and real-time data as well as an innovative and experimental approach to building and Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system simulation."
