## Abstract
"Solutions for monitoring and control of the digital technologies in the residential and tertiary sector are lagging in terms of data exchange and easy deployment. The question arises whether current technologies allow cross-functional integration of data. This paper explores an IoT (Internet of Things) solution in controlling the HVAC system and monitoring of environmental, electric and comfort parameters in a real building. The implemented IoT solution proved to be flexible in terms of data exchange, deployment and debugging time in small and medium-size buildings and thus the IoT integration-based approach to be more efficient. This approach opens new possibilities for a wider set of beneficiaries. As future research, we are considering both extending our solution to other buildings within the university campus premises and on developing predictive analytics services."
