## Abstract
"For residential buildings, improving the energy efficiency of buildings helps to reduce energy consumption, as well as to benefit households through reduced energy-related costs. However, very little research has focused on understanding how energy efficiency investments are made, particularly across different socioeconomic groups. This research thus analyzes the energy efficiency investments of households in lower and higher income regions using frequency, correlation, and principal component analysis. Data used are for residential buildings in Cedar Falls, Iowa, including energy efficiency investment data for a utility rebate program, assessors data, and U.S. Census data. Among the technologies studied, air conditioners and furnaces (HVAC) were the most expensive, yet they were among the most common types of investments. Comparing efficiency investments in lower and higher income regions, overall, the higher income tract prioritized efficient lighting and HVAC systems with less insulation investments, while the lower income tract invested most in HVAC systems andinsulation. Results also suggest that for housing units in lower income regions invested more in high efficiency HVAC systems, as compared to the higher income regions. These findings highlight the importance of incentive programs that are tailored to needs and priorities of lower-income and higher-income housing units and the variations in investment behavior."
