## Abstract
"Smart buildings and building automation are key components for achieving greater energy efficiency. In order to implement predictive control for the HVAC system and natural ventilation, the model needs to have the capability to predict building thermal responses under various environmental and operational conditions. This task can be accomplished by using a deep neural network, which would capture the effects of complicated physical processes, such as natural ventilation. However, a deep neural network comes with a high demand for training data. In real-world applications, the target building may not have the necessary amount of operational data available. This study demonstrates how transfer learning could solve this dilemma. By freezing partial weights of a deep neural network model that is pretrained on multi-year data from a base case building, it can be quickly deployed to different buildings in other climates. With much fewer trainable parameters, the model can then be well-trained on only 15 days of data from the new target building. The base case and target case can have entirely different floor areas, building materials, and window sizes. This transfer learning model performs significantly better than a comparable model that is only trained on source data or target data, achieving high predicting accuracy on both indoor air temperature and relative humidity in the time horizon from 10 minutes to two hours. This methodology can be applied to the design of the control system in a new building. It has a high sample efficiency and shortens the minimum data collection period for model training."
