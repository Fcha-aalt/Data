## Abstract
"Residential HVAC system control has been focused on thermal comfort and energy consumption. Due to the complexity of the dynamic building thermal model, weather conditions and human activities, traditional methods such as rule-based control (RBC) and model predictive control (MPC) are difficult to learn a strategy that can save energy while satisfying occupants’ thermal comfort requirements. To solve the above problem, we propose a method combining a thermal comfort prediction model and reinforcement learning to optimize residential multi-zone HVAC control. In this paper, we first design a hybrid model of Support Vector Regression and a Deep Neural Network (SVR-DNN) to predict thermal comfort value, which is taken as a part of the state and reward in reinforcement learning. Then we apply reinforcement learning algorithms (Q-learning, Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)) to respectively generate an optimal HVAC control strategy to maintain the stability of thermal comfort and minimize energy consumption. The experimental results show that our SVR-DNN model can improve thermal comfort prediction performance by 20.5 % compared with the deep neural network (DNN); compared with rule-based control, DDPG, DQN and Q-learning based on SVR-DNN can reduce energy consumption by 11.89 %, 8.41 %, 6.51 % and reduce thermal comfort violation by 91.8 %, 43.2 %, 25.4 %."
