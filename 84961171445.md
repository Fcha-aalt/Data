## Abstract
"This paper describes an innovative energy management methodology to support intelligent decision-making that ensures both energy efficiency and savings. At the core is the EC VERYSchool project, a result-oriented and industry led and market driven project co-funded by the European Commission under the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP-ICT-PSP 2011). VERYSchool demonstrated how an effective energy action management based on the ISO 50001 standard and the successfully integration of cutting-edge ICTs, such as smart meters, smart control functions for HVAC and lighting, energy simulation modeling, with the Enerit ISO 50001 software suite has realized a complete Energy Action Navigator system (a web based platform called VSNavigator). The result is a high degree of innovation with significant energy, environmental, socio and economic challenges and impacts, while contributing to the Near-Zero Energy Buildings concept. Along with school buildings, the high degree of repeatability of the VERYSchool methodology, extends to all building sectors and large energy infrastructures."
