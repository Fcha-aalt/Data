## Abstract
"Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in a production environment ensure safe and comfortable environmental conditions and require a significant amount of final energy in the industry. In this paper a complete cyber-physical HVAC system is presented, which is implemented in an incremental production environment to ensure these conditions. Incremental manufacturing is a concept for a flexible production system that combines additive manufacturing, subtractive manufacturing processes and other production technologies. With the cyber-physical HVAC system, energy efficiency, air quality and thermal conditions can be improved in the incremental production environment, by providing decision support, greater transparency and enabling model-predictive control in real time."
