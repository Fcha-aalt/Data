## Abstract
"Intermittent renewable energy supply combined with electric and thermal energy storage technologies can cover the highest possible share of electricity, heating and cooling needs. However, their integration within the HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning) systems could result in far too complex installations, requiring intelligent energy management platforms for achieving their energy-efficient work. This paper introduces a cloud-based control platform, deployed to one such multi-source/sink renewable energy system, that performs all control and monitoring tasks through its hierarchically organized algorithm structure. This cascade control paradigm entails conventional control enrichment by more intelligent superior optimization, which evaluates not only the current energy demand and state of resources but also the inherent flexibility on the demand side and predictive aspects of the local energy production from renewables. On the other hand, the control system layered architecture relies on SCADA system solution, with proven modularity, flexibility and connectivity, making the system easily upgradeable and accessible by the end-users."
