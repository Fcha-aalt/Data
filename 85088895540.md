## Abstract
"This paper applied the POET framework to analyze and identify possible energy efficiency activities that may reduce energy costs in HVAC cooling systems with Ice Thermal Energy Storage (ITES) in order to achieve maximum potential cost-savings, particularly for cooling loads in commercial buildings. Significant cost savings may be realized by the optimal shifting of the energy usage profile to the least costly regions of the Time-of-Use (TOU) using the ITES system. Moreover, a further reduction of energy costs may be achieved by introducing renewable energy (RE) sourced systems. A potential reduction of approximately 50% in energy cost savings could be achieved with the application of the POET framework. Improvement in operational efficiency may be achieved if systems were optimally sized and controlled. Studies conducted on control methods have shown that Model Predictive Control (MPC) offers significant benefits of achieving reasonable operational efficiency compared to other methods, particularly on HVAC systems. Combined ITES and hybrid energy systems allow an additional advantage in demand-side management, per the TOU tariff and peak demand. This may ultimately result in minimal energy usage during the costly regions of the TOU tariff, which would minimize energy costs and technology and equipment efficiency may be improved."
