## Abstract
"Increased use of energy in buildings and HVAC systems requires advanced control schemes like model-based control to improve energy efficiency, which in turn requires accurate thermodynamic models of buildings. The Resistive-Capacitive (RC) method is a popular and versatile approach for thermal modeling of buildings. Despite this, it is not easy to find practical solutions of implementation of the RC method. It is the goal of this paper to clarify the RC method and demonstrate simple implementation of this method, especially for multi-zone buildings, which have more potential for energy savings from use of model-based control. This paper provides two contributions. First is a detailed explanation of the RC method, focusing on its use for developing a structure of a model and first-principles approach for estimation of parameters of a model. Second is a demonstration of an algorithm that enables automatic development of the structure of a model from basic information about a building (layout, construction elements) and its combination with data-based parameter estimation. Use of the algorithm is presented with a case-study on industrial multi-zone building, for which such a grey-box model is developed and analyzed. The resulting model is rapidly developed and used in a simulation with the measured data. The outputs of the model are compared with the measured temperatures and they show good fit."
