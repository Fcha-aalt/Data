## Abstract
"Augmented Reality (AR) has great potential for new didactic concepts in teaching. Environments, information and objects can be comprehensively and dynamically represented, supporting self-paced and holistic learning. This paper presents an implementation of a multimodal AR-application for the purpose of teaching complex features and mechanics of a 'Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning System' in a situated and engaging way. The application was designed and implemented by an interdisciplinary team and evaluated in a mixed-methods approach. Results show a high usability and acceptance of the application. Students recognized the benefit of the application regarding their motivation and learning gains and made suggestions for further improvements."
