## Abstract
"According to the recast of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive and its target for the large-scale increase of nearly-zero energy buildings, nowadays a challenging task is the definition of standard high performing building types depending on location and specific climate conditions. The widespread replicability of nZEB types on the current real estate market could implement nZEB design scenarios attractive and affordable for construction companies and private investors. In particular, this research focuses on the definition of replicable HVAC system configurations with different features and efficiencies starting from a reference building located in a Mediterranean country. The configurations were applied to CorTau House, an nZEB under construction in Piedmont Region, a typical situation of European Mediterranean country where both winter and summer loads, together with humidity, have to be carefully controlled. Building envelope and HVAC system design were matched in order to optimize energy performance and indoor thermal comfort. The HVAC configurations, able to meet nZEB targets and to ensure optimal indoor comfort conditions, were combined with a performing building envelope, made of local construction materials, in order to assess which of them is more energy effective and economically viable. Cost-optimal types were identified and prospective replicability on building market was speculated. Finally, differences between private investor's and company construction's perspectives were discussed."
