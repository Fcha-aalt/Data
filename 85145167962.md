## Abstract
"Energy efficiency criteria are important in Green Building Rating (GBR) systems, and the requirements vary depending on the GBR system. A comparison study is conducted to distinguish between two major GBR systems used in India: Indian Green Building Council Green Homes (IGBC GH) and Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA). The energy simulation software eQuest was used to forecast annual energy demand for a case study multi-family residential building with various design scenarios. Various design combinations for the roof envelope, wall envelope, and HVAC efficiency were chosen, and the possibilities of meeting the energy efficiency criteria of the two GBR systems were discussed. It was discovered that an improvement made based on envelope condition, the efficiency of the HVAC system considered in this study, and assigning renewable energy gives higher energy performance under IGBC Green Homes, with the possibility of achieving full credit points, but the combinations discussed did not give the full credit points for GRIHA. GRIHA, in particular, requires a significant reduction in HVAC load to receive full credit. GRIHA requires more renewable energy allocation than IGBC GH because renewable energy for achieving credit points is a percentage of HVAC, lighting, and domestic hot water consumption, whereas IGBC GH is a percentage of common area lighting consumption."
