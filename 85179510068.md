## Abstract
"The use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to evaluate indoor air quality and thermal comfort performance has been widely adopted. However, it remains a computationally demanding process that requires prior experience in commercially available codes. Thus, it cannot be used adequately in a fast-paced early HVAC design stage. This paper explores the efficacy of a surrogate model for real-time prediction of steady turbulent flow within the context of the indoor environment. The proposed approach employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict physical properties of the environment such as air velocity, dry-bulb temperature and age of air on a plane positioned at 1.2m above ground. The proposed surrogate model is capable of predicting results with low mean average errors (0.315, 0.931, 0.017, 0.016 for temperature, age of air, Ux and Uy respectively) and four orders of magnitude faster than a standard CFD simulation for a similar scenario, thereby enabling fast explorations of design options, especially useful in the early stage of the design."
