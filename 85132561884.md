## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 179 papers. The topics discussed include: laser intensity-assisted construction material classification in point cloud data using deep learning; implementing Haar cascade classifiers for automated rapid detection of light aircraft at local airports; natural language processing application in construction domain: an integrative review and algorithms comparison; prediction-enabled collision risk estimation for safe human-robot collaboration on unstructured and dynamic construction sites; characterizing perceived data sharing barriers and promotion strategies in civil engineering; improving 2d construction plans with cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks; assessing exposure to slip, trip, and fall hazards by measuring construction worker loss of balance; a machine learning-based framework for automatic bridge deck condition assessment using ground penetrating radar; improving the prediction accuracy of data-driven fault diagnosis for HVAC systems by applying the synthetic minority oversampling technique; and identifying temporal instability in factors causing work zone crash occurrences using fast causal inference."
