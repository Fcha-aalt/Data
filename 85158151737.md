## Abstract
"The inefficiency, labor-intensity, and possibility of automation of the current practice of HVAC system inspections, which heavily relies on human inspectors, are being questioned. This paper describes a lightweight and reproducible robotic system dubbed AcTEA-bot, that automatically detects and locates thermal leaks in ceiling environments while self-navigating. AcTEA-bot is designed and built upon three modules, including an active visual SLAM module, a thermal leak detection module, and a thermal leak registration module. To evaluate the effectiveness of AcTEA-bot, a true-to-scale ceiling environment containing five thermal leaks is built, and 30 experiments are conducted where AcTEA-bot starts with different poses and conducts the inspection task. Results demonstrate that thermal leaks of multiple types in ceiling environments can be accurately detected and located."
