## Abstract
"In this study, we propose a methodology to assign HVAC operation planning schemes for connected buildings with the objective of energy saving and load leveling. The idea is to use building thermal inertia in a periodic pattern by relaxing the temperature setpoints to an upper bound and setting back to a lower bound to avoid air conditioning while the room is still within human comfort zone. This periodic operation planning in turn facilitates the collaboration across a building community to reduce the aggregate demand. The objective is to assign periodic temperature setpoints for a building cluster so that the aggregate cooling electric demand reduces with the minimum cost and steady aggregate load shape. Ideal operation schedule forms are identified and elaborated in detail. Human comfort level and demand-side management applications are evaluated and incorporated into an optimization framework. The impact of peak demand reduction on the grid and power generation costs and the impact on the society is also investigated. The results demonstrate up to 12.5% savings in electricity consumption and 10% peak demand reduction for a community of 26 buildings."
