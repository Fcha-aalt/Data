## Abstract
"Energy efficiency in the building sector, where approximately 40% of total end-use energy is consumed [1], is a major concern today. Approximately half of building energy is used for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) [2]. A sustainable and potentially optimal solution (optimal in the context of mathematical optimization) for energyefficient buildings is to integrate renewable energy resources (for example, solar and geothermal energy [3]-[6]) into the structures and use intelligent advanced model-based control methods (AMBCMs). A significant potential exists for energy savings in the building sector since most buildings have manual or rule-based HVAC control systems, which may not be energy efficient [7], [8], and many buildings lack renewable energy integration."
