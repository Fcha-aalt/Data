## Abstract
"This paper presents evaluation of the energy consumption and tracking performance associated with the use of a recently introduced dual-mode model predictive controller (DMMPC) for control of a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. The study was conducted using detailed simulations of an HVAC system, which included a multizone air loop, a water loop, and a chiller. Energy consumption and tracking performance are computed from the simulations and evaluated in the presence of different types and magnitudes of noise and disturbances. Performance of the DMMPC is compared with a baseline proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control structure commonly used for HVAC system control, and this comparison showed clear and consistent superiority of the DMMPC."
