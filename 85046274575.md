## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 73 papers. The topics discussed include: analysis of cold chain carbon footprint of fruits and vegetables in China; a study of improving energy efficiency of small supermarkets by modelling interactions between building, HVAC, refrigeration and display product; application of vortex control to a transcritical R744 ejector cycle; effect of indirect ice slurry cooling, low temperature transpiration and different retailing methods on the circulation quality of cauliflower; comparative study of various supermarket refrigerating systems in European climate context; freeze-thaw stability of Konjac glucomannane-potato starch gels:stability from macroscopic to microscopic scale, using image processing; evaluation of microwave assisted freezing (MAF) impact on meat and fish matrices; freezewave H2020 project-microwave assisted freezing of potato; research on heating performance of air source heat pump system utilized in small residential buildings; numerical simulation and experiment on the relationship between lettuce forced-air precooling uniformity and air supply speed; numerical study on frosting characteristics of air coolers; comparative study on electric heater defrosting of gravity feeding refrigeration system; experimental study on single-refrigerant cascade refrigeration system; reduction of energy consumption by applying a new generation of CO2 compressors; and certified energy consultant for increasednumber of retail grocery stores with low energy use, safe operation and low environmental impact."
