## Abstract
"In this paper, a novel fresh air handling system was proposed, which takes full use of the geothermal energy to cool or heat the fresh air by using a ground source heat exchanger and an air-water heat exchanger. The ground source heat exchanger extracts heat from the ground and transfers the heat to the fresh air through an air-water heat exchanger. The dynamic simulation software TRNSYS was used to analyze the energy efficiency of this novel fresh air handling system with the climate of Beijing. The results show that, with a reasonable design and operation conditions, the average COP of the novel system is 10.2 ~ 13.7 in a continuous operation scenario and 12.9 ~ 16.2 in an intermittent operation scenario. For a typical office room equipped with this novel fresh air handling system, the free-running temperature under 28Â°C accounts for 86.8% of the occupied time, which proves that ventilation with the novel fresh air handling system can extend the non-air conditioning period and save energy significantly."
