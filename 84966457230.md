## Abstract
"This study combines an analysis of Ecuador's national policies and programs on energy audit practices with information collected from a variety of local institutions involved in energy auditing activities. Despite Ecuador is addressing a cleaner energy matrix by the construction of eight new hydroelectric power plants by 2017, the sustainable use of energy does not only require increasing renewable energy production, but also using it efficiently. At first, the institutional framework concentrating on the regulatory gap to promote energy audits in the country is assessed. Furthermore, the international energy audit practice with a focus on government policies, energy audit standards, tools, and techniques applied on heat, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, lighting and insulation is discussed. A gap analysis of Ecuador's energy auditing programs compared to international practice is also addressed. Finally, policy recommendations, based on international experienced, for facilitating effective energy practice in the country are highlighted."
