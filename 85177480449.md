## Abstract
"A Passive Fault Tolerant Control (PFTC) based on deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach has been proposed in this work. The RL agent is responsible for controlling a heating system in order to regulate the indoor temperature of an area. During operation, faults may occur in the heating system, particularly at the level of the internal resistance of the boiler and the pump responsible for the flow of water injected into the pipes to heat the area. The RL agent has been trained without the presence of a fault either in a holy environment and the goal is to see his behavior when the fault appears. The agent manages even without prior training to adapt and propose a PFTC to guarantee an interior temperature faithful to the set temperature while ensuring minimizing the energy consumed and good use of the heating system to guarantee a long equipment life."
