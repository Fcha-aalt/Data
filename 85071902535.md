## Abstract
"Flammable refrigerants are becoming more widely used in industrial, commercial (stationary and mobile), and residential applications a conventional hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants. In addition to having low global warming potential and ovpne depletion levels, HVAC&K systems these alternative refrigerants have demonstrated improved performance and energy efficiencies. However, despite these advantages, pose an increased fire risk over conventional non-flammable refrigerants in the end-use. In this paper, the thermodynamic cycle pressures, temp and efficiencies of several common flammable and non-flammable refrigerants are compared. Typical hazard scenarios for light commerci applications are illustrated with event trees, hazard thresholds are discussed, and some precautions are given. Lessons learned through conduded research projects are also presented and concluded with recommendations when working with flammable refrigerants."
