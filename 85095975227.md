## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 31 papers. The topics discussed include: controlling sunlight entering the indoor space through windows using dual solar screens; energy comparison of air conditioning split system vs. solar absorption systems with optimization for a prototype educational building; contributing algorithms of energy efficiency and renewable energy in the residential, commercial and industrial sectors; establishment of a sustainable energy action plan: case study of union of municipalities; design optimization for maintaining occupants’ outdoor thermal comfort; transition engineering the water electricity nexus operating in building services and urban heat islands – concept design – is air conditioning really necessary?; holistic approach to energy performance of green built environment; and benefits from combination of centralized ventilation system and decentralized conditioning units."
