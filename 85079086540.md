## Abstract
"In office buildings, the space layout usually needs to be repeatedly redesigned in order to meet tenants’ requirements during the building's life cycle. In this study, the effect of a flexible space layout design on thermal comfort and energy demand is investigated in a modern open-plan office space. Using dynamic thermal simulation, the applicability of three different HVAC systems (mechanical ventilation, radiant ceiling and a thermally-active building system) combined with four control zoning strategies are assessed. Finding a robust solution for each configuration and control strategy can support design decisions during the design planning or interior renovation phase. The main objective is to enable a flexible space layout design during the complete building life cycle without compromising on thermal comfort or energy efficiency. The results show that radiant ceilings and thermally-active building systems are promising solutions for flexible office spaces in the location of Stuttgart, whereas mechanical ventilation systems require a more complex control strategy to ensure thermal comfort. Connecting the field of building controls with parametric building modeling enables flexible space layout designs to be assessed with different HVAC systems."
