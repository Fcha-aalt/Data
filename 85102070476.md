## Abstract
"In recent years, the Iraqi construction sector has faced many abandoned projects that have a negative impact on stakeholders, the economy, and the environment. Retrofitting existing buildings offer significant opportunities to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions since buildings consume the largest amount of energy. The research methodology adopting building information Modeling (BIM) technology, is one of the modern techniques for retrofitting abandoned buildings to achieve low energy buildings and reduce the environmental effect. The concept of the study is applied to one of the projects in Iraq. The author finds that the use of BIM technology is very useful in carrying out various analyses and helping to find retrofitting strategies to improve the energy efficiency of the project. The results showed that the energy savings of 24% of the total improvement compared to the baseline design situation and the most efficient alternatives are heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems with energy savings of 71.36 kWh/m2 .year."
