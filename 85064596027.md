## Abstract
"Smart Grid Demand Side Management is the effective way for energy providers to encourage their customers on reducing their consumption during peak loads through several Demand Response programs. In this paper, An Artificial Intelligence approach based on a Fuzzy Logic control system is proposed for the home appliance scheduling problem. This is typically used in Home Energy Management Systems for the control of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning Systems (HVAC). The simulation results demonstrate the capability of the proposed model to manage and control of HVAC systems in a smarter way than traditional techniques. Furthermore, a reduction of 18.33% in total hourly energy consumption has been obtained after introducing a new parameter among the fuzzy input variables."
