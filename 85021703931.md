## Abstract
"Cogeneration (CHP) and Heat Pump (HP) are playing a key role in energy systems due to their high efficiency, especially, in energy refurbishment of buildings and industrial processes. This paper explored the opportunity to couple those two well-established technologies for heating purposes. Basically, the coupling entails limitations and constraints consisting of the mismatch between the power sizes of merchandised machines as well as the deriving technical issues. The main aim of this paper is to analyse the coupling procedure to help HVAC specialists in their job. This paper deals with a simple model formulation, based on the First Law of thermodynamics, for CHP/HP systems rating and off-design operations. Indeed, an analytical method was designed along with the definition of a size factor. Then, a graphical method for coupling CHP and HP was presented so as to be an expeditious tool in designing phase. Finally, two numerical applications were illustrated highlighting the energy performance gains and the high level of operation flexibility."
