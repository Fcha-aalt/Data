## Abstract
"This paper presents a smart system iBeam which is a smart learning and networked air conditioning system designing by using a Model – View – Controller (MVC) model. This is a learning and networked Internet of Thing (IoT) system that can predict the thermal comfort of the occupants and regulate the air-conditioning temperature using Machine Learning algorithm in order to give an ideal thermal comfort and indoor air quality with the most minimal vitality cost. This system consists of an Android app to collect user’s input, a server to run Machine Learning algorithm and to associate with a database that stores values from sensors such as temperature or humidity level. The app and the server communicate to each other through a Representational State Transfer web-service."
