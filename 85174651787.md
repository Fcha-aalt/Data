## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 16 papers. The topics discussed include: a control strategy for MMC variable-frequency drive; research on control system of new energy storage combined thermal power unit based on improved voltage droop control; adaptive time period aggregation for day-ahead unit commitment; controlling time-variant virtual inertia: a dynamic programming approach; data visualization of film capacitors; day-ahead scheduling strategy based on interaction between the power system and electric loads; DC line protection scheme of all-DC offshore wind transmission system; demand response strategy for HVAC based on reinforcement learning and imitation learning; distributed robust optimal scheduling of multi-energy complementary based on Wasserstein distance; distribution grid voltage regulation strategy based on adaptive control of distributed PV inverter; and insulation condition assessment of cable intermediate joint based topsis method with variable weight."
