## Abstract
"The Internet of Things (IoT) has resulted in increased data quantities, which are predicted to continue to grow tremendously. The Internet of Things has great potential for positive change in society, from this point of view. This paper is designed in such a way that many elderly people and people with disabilities receive daily benefits, and this is done using sensors and microcontrollers to achieve automation with the widely used android mobile operating system. The home appliances and electrical devices can be controlled by Bluetooth wireless communication protocol and android mobile from anywhere out of the house when the appliances are not switched off. Numerous home appliances and electrical devices such as fans, refrigerators, lights, etc., can be controlled by the android OS. Home automation can include the control of HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), lighting, security locks of gates and doors, home appliances, and devices to provide and improve convenience, comfort, energy efficiency, and security. Home automation for people with disabilities and elders can provide a better quality of life for those who may need care or nursing facilities."
