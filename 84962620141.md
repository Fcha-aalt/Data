## Abstract
"In the present case study - an airport located at the southern region of Portugal with an increasing number of passengers (more than 5.7 million passengers) - a web-based monitoring system was installed, collecting, displaying and registering the information generated by a wireless network of sensors. The monitoring of indoor environmental quality parameters, along with billed energy data control and outdoor weather conditions observation, permitted a continuous tuning of the HVAC systems set-points. Through the comparison of a six month period in two consecutive monitored years, during the cooling season, energy savings up to 13.4% in the HVAC system were achieved."
