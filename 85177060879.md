## Abstract
"The relationship between thermal comfort, building floor levels, and HVAC energy consumption in tropical high-rise residential buildings remains unclear. These buildings face heavy cooling demands due to their immense height and volume, as well as hot-humid weather found in the tropics. Architects and building developers understand that an increase in a building's floor count increases its energy requirements, but the impact on occupant thermal requirements and AC energy consumption needs further investigation. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between passive thermal comfort, AC energy consumption, and floor levels in tropical high-rise residential buildings through survey and experimental methods. The results showed a significant relationship between thermal sensation votes and building floor levels, as well as AC energy consumption and floor levels. The study also found a strong correlation between thermal sensation votes and predicted mean votes, AC energy use, and predicted people dissatisfied. The optimal cut-off floors for thermal dissatisfaction according to (TSV) are 22nd floor and 8th floor in summer and monsoon seasons respectively. With a 90% sensitivity and 92% specificity. This research highlights the importance of addressing thermal comfort in high-rise buildings to improve energy efficiency and thermal comfort in tropical climates."
