## Abstract
"The intelligent buildings provided various incentives to get highly inefficient energy-saving caused by the non-stationary building environments. In the presence of such dynamic excitation with higher levels of nonlinearity and coupling effect of temperature and humidity, the HVAC system transitions from underdamped to overdamped indoor conditions. This led to the promotion of highly inefficient energy use and fluctuating indoor thermal comfort. To address these concerns, this study develops a novel framework based on deep clustering of lagrangian trajectories for multi-task learning (DCLTML) and adding a pre-cooling coil in the air handling unit (AHU) to alleviate a coupling issue. The proposed DCLTML exhibits great overall control and is suitable for multi-objective optimisation based on cooperative multi-agent systems (CMAS). The framework of DCLTML is used greedy iterative training to get an optimal set of weights and tabulated as a layer for each clustering structure. Such layers can deal with the challenges of large space and its massive data. Then the layer weights of each cluster are tuned by the Quasi-Newton (QN) algorithm to make the action sequence of CMAS optimal. Such a policy of CMAS effectively manipulates the inputs of the AHU, where the agents of the AHU activate the natural ventilation and set chillers into an idle state when the outdoor temperature crosses the recommended value. So, it is reasonable to assess the impact potential of thermal mass and hybrid ventilation strategy in reducing cooling energy; accordingly, the assigning results of the proposed DCLTML show that its main cooling coil saves >40% compared to the conventional benchmarks. Besides significant energy savings and improving environmental comfort, the DCLTML exhibits superior high-speed response and robustness performance and eliminates fatigue and wear due to shuttering valves. The results show that the DCLTML algorithm is a promising new approach for controlling HVAC systems. It is more robust to environmental variations than traditional controllers, and it can learn to control the HVAC system in a way that minimises energy consumption. The DCLTML algorithm is still under development, but it can potentially revolutionise how HVAC systems are controlled."
