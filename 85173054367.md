## Abstract
"De La Salle University is committed to reducing its impact on the environment and to promoting positive action that will help reduce its carbon footprint. In its vision-mission, it emphasizes the need to be “attuned to a sustainable earth.” This paper presents the different initiatives and challenges faced by the university, especially while still in a global pandemic. A number of initiatives have been undertaken to promote energy efficiency in campus operations and climate action, particularly regarding reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, facing the COVID-19 pandemic and preparing campus operations for the gradual resumption of face-to-face classes have presented new challenges moving into the next normal. The need to address health and safety concerns has resulted in increased consumption of electricity. Challenges are experienced particularly in ensuring improved indoor air quality as well as allowing indoor-outdoor air exchange. The setting up of (a) air purifiers and/or additional auxiliary fans in high foot-traffic areas, (b) installation of HEPA filters and UV-C lamps into HVAC systems, (c) extended use of air conditioning units to allow purging of air before and at the end of activities, and (d) the opening of air exchange dampers in the University’s HVAC systems, are all expected to result in increased demand for electricity."
