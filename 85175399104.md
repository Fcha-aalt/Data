## Abstract
"ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1 regulates the energy efficiency and renewable energy use of buildings except low-rise residential buildings. The 2022 edition of Standard 90.1 incorporates numerous changes to the building envelope, lighting, mechanical, service hot water and renewable energy systems. These changes span both the prescriptive and performance compliance paths and will be described in a series of articles in ASHRAE Journal over the next several months. Throughout this series, we will cover the major topic areas, including HVAC, lighting and power, energy credits and energy modeling and performance. This month's article will cover several changes that were introduced to the envelope requirements of Standard 90.1-2022."
