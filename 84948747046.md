## Abstract
"Growing environmental consciousness and rising energy prices have emphasized the need for substantial energy savings in the single-family residential building sector. To achieve this, more stringent performance requirements are needed. The intent of this work is to develop a framework and preliminary policy implementation strategy to achieve an 80% reduction in heating energy consumption by 2035 for newly constructed single-family dwellings across Ontario (Canada). A tiered framework of heating energy consumption targets was developed using current (2012) Ontario building code requirements as the baseline and building enclosure/HVAC requirements estimated as necessary to achieve the Passive House Standard in Ontario’s two climate zones. An Ontario based large track homebuilder estimated construction capital costs for each tier to examine potential cost barriers against implementation. A significant cost premium of over $65 000 (CAD) (54%) exists between the baseline consumption and the overall 80% heating energy reduction target; a result of unfamiliarity and lack of experience designing and constructing to the proposed levels. This research concludes a large gap exists between early adopters and the mainstream construction industry in terms of super-insulated house construction."
