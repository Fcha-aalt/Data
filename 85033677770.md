## Abstract
"Conventional HVAC systems rely heavily on energy generated from fossil fuels, which are being rapidly depleted. This - together with a growing demand for cost-effective infrastructure and appliances - has necessitated new installations and major retrofits in occupied buildings to achieve energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. As such, the development of clean energy air conditioning units remains an urgent engineering challenge. Solar HVAC systems, which convert thermal energy into cool air, are known to be an efficient source of heating and cooling. Unlike traditional HVAC systems, solar air conditioning units produce maximum cooling capacity when the sun is fierce; that is, they are most efficient during the hottest part of the day, in stark contrast to traditional air conditioning units, which are less effective as temperatures increase."
