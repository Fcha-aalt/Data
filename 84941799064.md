## Abstract
"The chillers are important refrigeration components of building air-conditioning systems and their operational status is directly related to the building's HVAC system performance and stability. The issue of fault diagnosis of chillers has received wide attention. This paper will feature Characteristic Modelling Technology in fault diagnosis for chillers and modelling with fuzzy Petri net technique. Using fuzzy Petri nets knowledge representation and inference algorithm for matrix operations describes the characteristic parameters of chiller fault indication and relationships. Using the proposed diagnostic systems can take full advantage of the information resources of characteristic parameters for fault diagnosis, and according to chiller efficiency indexes of COP a comprehensive diagnosis of fault diagnosis and chiller can run efficiently. The test results of plant running show the feasibility and accuracy of the fault diagnostic system."
