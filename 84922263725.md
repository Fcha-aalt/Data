## Abstract
"In this work an overview regarding smart electrochromic windows as a promising technology capable of providing significant energy savings in buildings is presented. Electrochromic windows are devices able to control of light and acclimatization of indoor spaces. Therefore, these technologies allow energy savings with lighting and HVAC systems of these spaces. These devices are already commercially available and research and development in such field is increasing, due to its technological and financial importance."
