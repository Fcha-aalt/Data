## Abstract
"The construction sector is responsible for almost 30% of the world’s total energy consumption, with a significant portion of this energy being used by heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems to ensure people’s thermal comfort. In practical applications, the conventional approach to HVAC management in buildings typically involves the manual control of temperature setpoints by facility operators. Nevertheless, the implementation of real-time alterations that are based on the thermal comfort levels of humans inside a building has the potential to dramatically improve the energy efficiency of the structure. Therefore, we propose a model for non-intrusive, dynamic inference of occupant thermal comfort based on building indoor surveillance camera data. It is based on a two-stream transformer-augmented adaptive graph convolutional network to identify people’s heat-related adaptive behaviors. The transformer specifically strengthens the original adaptive graph convolution network module, resulting in further improvement to the accuracy of the detection of thermal adaptation behavior. The experiment is conducted on a dataset including 16 distinct temperature adaption behaviors. The findings indicate that the suggested strategy significantly improves the behavior recognition accuracy of the proposed model to 96.56%. The proposed model provides the possibility to realize energy savings and emission reductions in intelligent buildings and dynamic decision making in energy management systems."
