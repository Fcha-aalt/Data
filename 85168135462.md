## Abstract
"The strategic plan put in place by Italy to face this crisis aimed at environmental sustainability, was based on a tax deduction of 110% (divided into 5 annual quotas) aimed at promoting energy efficiency measures for existing buildings, even for fulfilling the new requirements of the energy efficiency in buildings and cities provided by the Directive EU 844/2018. This investigation, employing semi-stationary approach based on real case study and data, proposes a critical analysis of several passive and active energy efficiency measures for residential buildings, belonging to different climates. Considering the energy, and economic indicators, it is shown how it is really important to provide funding program for boosting the diffusion of energy efficiency measures. Indeed, also if the combination of measures on the building envelope and the HVAC system allows important energy saving (-60% -80%) the investment cost is still very high and the tenants may not be interested in the effects of a sustainable intervention if pay-back period is too high."
