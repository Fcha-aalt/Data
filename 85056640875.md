## Abstract
"This work assessed the energy performance of a non-residential service building in Jordan. A comprehensive energy audit was conducted through which building systems were investigated including the building envelope, HVAC, and lighting systems. Multiple site surveys were conducted using standard audit instruments to record different operating conditions. Energy analysis, consumption trends, and system specifications were all examined, additionally, retrofit solutions were proposed to enhance the efficiency of each system. Results indicated that replacing all the single glazed windows with double-glazed thermally broken windows could yield a reduction in total energy consumption by 9%. Moreover, installing LED fixtures instead of the existing fluorescent fixtures can lower the total annual energy consumption by 4%. Also, in this particular building, separating the building's first floor balcony terrace from the ground floor can reduce the total annual energy consumption by 13%. Additionally, using all proposed retrofit solutions can reduce the building total annual energy consumption by more than 33%."
