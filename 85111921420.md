## Abstract
"Systems for heating, cooling and ventilation, typically HVAC systems, are usually responsible for most of the electric energy consumed in the majority of university buildings, typically accounting for more than 40% of energy consumption. Recently, the two campuses of the University of Aveiro grew to 61 buildings and the energy for heating and cooling faced a serious problem since the constructed area increased with more 5 new buildings since 2011, with the expectation of increasing growth in the coming years. This paper presents the strategy followed by the university to find new sustainable solutions, using shallow geothermal systems in new buildings, to achieve nearly zero energy buildings. With that purpose a department building with ground source heat pump system was monitored, namely energy consumption of the building, indoor environmental conditions, including a survey through the users to evaluate the indoor thermal comfort and air quality. The monitoring data allow determining the energy efficiency of the HVAC geothermal system compared with traditional systems for heating and cooling used in similar department buildings without compromising the indoor comfort. The results show, that the use of shallow geothermal systems, should be highly incentivised for university departments buildings and another similar type of buildings for Aveiro region."
