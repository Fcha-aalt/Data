## Abstract
"The current cost that energy represents is crucial in a field like climate control which has high energy demands, therefore its reduction must be prioritized. The expansion of ICT and IoT come with an extensive deployment of sensors and computation infrastructure creating an opportunity to analyze and optimize energy management. Data on building internal and external conditions is essential for developing efficient control strategies in order to minimize energy consumption while maintaining usersâ€™ comfort inside. We here present a dataset that provides key features that could be useful for a wide range of applications in the context of modeling temperature and consumption via Artificial Intelligence algorithms. The data gathering has taken place for almost 1 year in the Pleiades building of the University of Murcia, which is a pilot building of the European project PHOENIX aiming to improve building energy efficiency."
