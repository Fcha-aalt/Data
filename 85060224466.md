## Abstract
"The emerging of building information modelling provides opportunities to break through the limitations of conventional building energy modelling such as tedious model preparation, model inconsistency and costly implementation, and promotes building energy modelling into the digital building design process. The method of using building information modelling for the building energy modelling process, named building information modelling-based building energy modelling has become a prevalent and attractive topic in both the research and the industry society in recent years. This paper presents an overall review on the building design process, and applications of building information modelling and building energy modelling in the design process. It also provides an in-depth review on the development of building information modelling-based building energy modelling methods and the development of prevalent informational infrastructures. Meanwhile, this literature review provides a special consideration on the maturity of building data transformation between building information modelling and building energy modelling for building energy simulation process, from the step 1 identifying the geometry, thermal properties of buildings to the step 6 the information and components for HVAC systems. In general, the current building information modelling-based building energy modelling methods are thoroughly evaluated and the trends for future developments are outlined. It is realised that the Building Information Modelling based Building Energy Modelling is particular appropriate for the early design stage, where the most suitable and cost effective approaches for energy efficient design can be integrated into the overall building design process."
