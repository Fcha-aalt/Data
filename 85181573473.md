## Abstract
"In the recent panorama, the use of conventional passenger vehicles has been discouraged from European level up to local municipalities. \"Reconfigurable light electric vehicle\" REFLECTIVE project targets at developing a light, fully electric vehicle capable of performing safely, efficiently, and multifacetedly in urban environments. By this way, it would be possible to fill the gap with the final user perception and electric vehicles market penetration. Moreover, in order to improve occupants' comfort, HVAC system has been considered as well, a feature which is not usually implemented in such a kind of vehicles. This paper will show results obtained for an integrated solution for cooling/HVAC circuits in terms of energy efficiency and occupants' comfort, with particular focus on proper battery operation. In fact, the battery thermal management is integrated into the HVAC circuit. The integrated circuit will take care of components' cooling so to guarantee proper operating conditions, HVAC for passenger comfort and battery thermal management so to assure proper operating conditions at the battery itself throughout different scenarios. Finally, the effectiveness of the control logic specifically developed for such an integrated circuit (HVAC/Cooling/Battery) will be shown in a urban driving cycle during winter season, so to maximize the heating loads both at powertrain and battery, with always assuring comfort conditions into the cabin."
