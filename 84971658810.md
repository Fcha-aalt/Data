## Abstract
"The U.S. government has recognized the irrefutable driving influence that the AEC industry has on the future development of local communities, energy infrastructure and even global standing. The Energy?Efficient Commercial Building Deduction, better known as IRS section 179D, rewards green construction with powerful tax savings that provide a significant means for reinvestment, money that will find itself recirculated back into local economies. Eligible contractors can expect to receive a tax deduction directly proportional to the percentage of their energy-reducing contributions, one square foot at a time. After a building is placed into service, its energy yield can be either calculated partially, divvied up by three categories of systems (lighting, HVAC or building envelope) or it can be calculated by the building's overall power reduction. One of the biggest challenges of 179D is navigating the allocation process. It's highly recommended that candidates pursue their allocation letters with urgency because 179D is usually a first-come, first-serve proposition."
