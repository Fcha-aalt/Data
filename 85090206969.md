## Abstract
"Currently, many intelligent building energy management systems (BEMSs) are emerging for saving energy in new and existing buildings and realizing a sustainable society worldwide. However, installing an intelligent BEMS in existing buildings does not realize an innovative and advanced society because it only involves simple equipment replacement (i.e., replacement of old equipment or LED (Light Emitting Diode) lamps) and energy savings based on a stand-alone system. Therefore, artificial intelligence (AI) is applied to a BEMS to implement intelligent energy optimization based on the latest ICT (Information and Communications Technologies) technology. AI can analyze energy usage data, predict future energy requirements, and establish an appropriate energy saving policy. In this paper, we present a dynamic heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) scheduling method that collects, analyzes, and infers energy usage data to intelligently save energy in buildings based on reinforcement learning (RL). In this regard, a hotel is used as the testbed in this study. The proposed method collects, analyzes, and infers IoT data from a building to provide an energy saving policy to realize a futuristic HVAC (heating system) system based on RL. Through this process, a purpose-oriented energy saving methodology to achieve energy saving goals is proposed."
