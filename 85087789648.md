## Abstract
"Electric vehicles (EVs) have obtained increasing public interest due to the associated economic and environmental benefits. Recently, studies regarding the economic advantages of adopting EVs as energy storages for commercial/residential buildings are emerging. In fact, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the industrial sector consumes more energy than all of the other sectors combined, which is about 54% of the world's total delivered energy. The energy consumption pattern in manufacturing facilities is based on production schedules and the heat transfer between machines and the ambient surroundings, thus, differs greatly from commercial/residential buildings. However, little research attention has been given to analyse the synergies of integrating EVs and manufacturing facilities to improve energy efficiency. To fill this research gap, in this study, a comprehensive model is established to evaluate the economic and environmental performance of an energy sharing system that consists of the EVs, power grid, and manufacturing facilities (EPM) under Time-of-Use (TOU) electricity tariff. The model is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming format by considering practical production schedules, heat exchange between machines and ambient surroundings, as well as the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. The case study results indicate that the presented EPMenergy sharing system has great potential to reduce energy cost and CO2 emissions. In addition, compared to the results from winter scenarios, it is shown that more cost savings can be achieved in summer days."
