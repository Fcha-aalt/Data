## Abstract
"This paper reports our experiences using the Building Information Modeling (BIM) approach within the FP7 project SEEDS (Self Learning Energy Efficient Buildings and open Spaces). SEEDS focuses on the development of an optimized Building Energy Management System (BEMS) that reduces the energy consumption and the CO2 emission of the building services during its operation phase based on self-learning techniques. One of the core components of the SEEDS architecture is the BEMS Energy Calculator which calculates the energy consumption of the building by means of a Facility Model at building operation time. In this paper, we introduce a new procedure for the automatic creation of BEMS Energy Calculator using a Multi-Model Approach which solves the drawbacks of the existing IFC models in relation to HVAC modeling. The ability of the purposed BIM-based approach for the design and operation phases is demonstrated in an application case. Â© 2015 Taylor & Francis Group."
