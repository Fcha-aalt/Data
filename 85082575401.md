## Abstract
"Buildings are the dominant end users of energy, as well as the largest contributors to CO2 emissions due to fossil fuels. As an investment, buildings possess the slowest turnover of capital stock, but also comprise the majority of any country's capital assets. Energy efficiency is thus extremely important in buildings, since it can offer expanding instead of diminishing returns, rendering the adoption of novel technologies imperative for the building & construction (B&C) industry. Designing low energy or zero energy buildings for hot and humid regions is a great challenge. Under climatic conditions of increased rainfall and humidity coupled with high ambient temperatures, typical energy efficiency technologies are not always sufficient. The aim of the present chapter is to focus on the most promising building energy technologies for hot and humid regions. The chapter is divided into three sections. The first section focuses on the building envelope technologies and more specifically to the incorporation of greenery in walls, facades and roofs as well as reflective technologies. The second section is dedicated to the active energy systems for hot and humid regions with specific focus on the desiccant air-conditioning systems. Finally, a series of case studies are presented in the third section."
