## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 157 papers. The topics discussed include: modeling carbon-energy metabolism of cities: a systems approach; streamlining photovoltaic deployment: the role of local governments in reducing soft costs; evaluation of solar PV and wind alternatives for self renewable energy supply: case study of shrimp cultivation; conditions for the cost effective combination of emissions trading and renewable energy support policies; the load control strategy of datacenter; thermal management of densely-packed EV battery with forced air cooling strategies; how does building occupancy influence energy efficiency of HVAC systems?; dynamic smoothness control for dual-motor-independent-drive electric vehicles based on kalman filter; and investigation of carbon tax pilot in YRD urban agglomerationsï¿½analysis and application of a novel ESER system with carbon tax constraints."
