## Abstract
"This article outlines the architecture of a cloud data center with low energy consumption for the HVAC system of a large gymnasium, and deeply analyzes the system form, equipment selection and configuration, energy-saving technical measures, etc.; evaluates the energy efficiency level through system research and design data calculations. In the operation management stage, theoretical analysis combined with operation experience to optimize the design framework and operation mode. The main air-conditioning energy-saving technologies should be able to provide corresponding technical support for the construction of HVAC projects. In addition, in the construction of HVAC projects, it is necessary to fully consider the actual construction and construction factors affecting HVAC projects. The analysis results show that energy consumption is reduced by 6.7%"
