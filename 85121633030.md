## Abstract
"The residential sector emits a substantial portion of greenhouse gasses. Heating and cooling account for a significant part of this emission, therefore energy-saving strategies for this part are vital. This study aims to investigate the effect of the IoT windows on heating and cooling load with designing a novel window that can change its g-value with a smart mid-shade. This study analyzes various situations of HVAC devices control strategies (comparison between a conventional thermostat and thermostat by occupant behavior control) and distinct window scenarios (comparison of different g-value of IoT window with a conventional window) in seven different climate zones for a one-story dwelling in the United States. Simulation has been done by EnergyPlus and Window software. For more reliable results, all the situations are simulated in four different directions. The analysis reveals the best scenarios based on energy saving of annual energy consumption for seven locations as following: 8.9% in Honolulu (Hawaii), 20.8% in Leon (Florida), 27% in Los Angeles (California), 26.3% in Bernalillo (New Mexico), 20.7% in Sangamon (Illinois), 19.5% in Sullivan (New York) and 17.8% in Itasca (Minnesota). Finally, the best scenario is simulated for each city based on economic and environmental indicators (the amount of CO2 emitted)."
