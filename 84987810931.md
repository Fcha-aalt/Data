## Abstract
"Good HVAC control is often the most cost-effective option to improve the energy efficiency of a factory. The effect of the control strategy and energy efficiency is usually difficult to predict. To achieve this easily, a fully automated energy saving controller system was designed for heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems in textile factories. The new designed HVAC control system reduces the energy consumption by 45%. These control system can be implemented in the factories with a direct payback period approximately 4 months."
