## Abstract
"Smart Home technology is the future of residential related technology which is designed to deliver and distribute number of services inside and outside the house via networked devices in which all the different applications & the intelligence behind them are integrated and interconnected. These smart devices have the potential to share information with each other given the permanent availability to access the broadband internet connection. Hence, Smart Home Technology has become part of IoT (Internet of Things). In this work, a home model is analyzed to demonstrate an energy efficient IoT based smart home. Several Multiphysics simulations were carried out focusing on the kitchen of the home model. A motion sensor with a surveillance camera was used as part of the home security system. Coupled with the home light and HVAC control systems, the smart system can remotely control the lighting and heating or cooling when an occupant enters or leaves the kitchen."
