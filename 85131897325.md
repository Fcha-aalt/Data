## Abstract
"After the outbreak of COVID-19, it is worrisome that how to cope with the spread of the pandemic. Ventilation is the most important engineering control measure, ASHRAE, REHVA, SHASE and authoritative institutions in China have issued many documents on how to apply HVAC system to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19, and thus this paper summarizes the contents related to the ventilation rate and air distribution. Besides, traditional total volume ventilation has the disadvantages of insufficient ventilation rate, less efficiency for short-term exposure events at short range and high energy consumption during the pandemic. Source control based on advanced air distribution has the advantages of high control efficiency, personalized adjustable, fast response and high energy saving potential, which can make up the disadvantages of the total volume ventilation scheme. Therefore, this paper systematically summarizes the technical types of source control based on advanced air distribution in coping the spread of respiratory infectious diseases. Considering that the design of ventilation system in the post-pandemic era is facing the development of \"combination of normal time and pandemic period\", the advantages of applying source control in the post-pandemic era and the application schemes of source control in high-risk scenarios are discussed, and the directions that need to be further explored in order to implement the design concept of\"combination of normal time and pandemic period\" are also discussed. This paper aims to provide a reference for the compilation of subsequent guidelines, and to bring some new ideas and enlightenments to the ventilation design for future pandemic prevention."
