## Abstract
"In the HVAC systems we can often find oversized equipment. In this study the most important question is that the oversized equipment how change their energy efficiency and consumption. In addition, the emitted noise and the control precision are mentioned in the connection with the oversizing as well. The following elements were examined: Boilers (standard, low-temperature and condensing), Pipeline, Control valve, Radiator, Chiller."
