## Abstract
"The article presents a method of calculating the annual energy consumption of internal utilities with simultaneous consideration of heat and electricity. The traditional system with heating devices and fan coils and an effective system with a single circuit of heat pump units are considered. A detailed description of the methodology for calculating the annual energy consumption of these systems is given. A detailed substantiation of the method of calculating the energy consumption of these systems is given. The energy efficiency of water loop heart pump system for the shopping and entertainment centers is analyzed. The flowchart of calculation of annual power consumption for traditional system and system with a single circuit of heat pump units is offered. The proposed method is applicable for calculations of the annual energy consumption of the heating system with heat pump included in the water loop and can be recommended for use as implement of choose of the circuit design."
