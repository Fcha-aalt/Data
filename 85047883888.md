## Abstract
"Research is focused on prevention of overheating in office buildings and shopping malls during mid-season season (saving potential is about 25% of total annual building gas consumption in Benelux countries). The majority of control algorithms of heating ventilation and air condition systems (HVAC) don't take into consideration future weather conditions. We pair existing HVAC systems with a cloud server to use more efficient algorithms on existing systems, develop supervisory on/off weather compensated control (Sup-WCC) and supervisory model predictive control (Sup-MPC) algorithms. Sup-WCC was implemented in production and Sup-MPC was tested on data from 3080 sq. m. building, located in The Netherlands."
