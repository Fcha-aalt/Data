## Abstract
"The building automation system (BAS) is part of the University HVAC system. It is used to monitor and save energy through energy performance contracting with different control systems. Recently, the HVAC laboratory facilities (Split-System Central Unit Heat Pump, Air Handling Units (AHUs), Variable Air Volumes (VAVs) box, and even a Wall-Mounted Heat Pump) have been incorporated into the University's BAS system to become a part of students' education. BAS is the foundation of the energy management efficiency of modern buildings. Basically, a central system, the intelligent Metasys BAS software, connects the HVAC, lighting, security and protection systems and allows them to communicate on a single platform to provide the necessary information to the energy manager; enabling them to make more informed decisions while improving occupant comfort, safety and productivity. Associated with HVAC systems, several BAS-related peripherals, such as Network Automation Engines (NAE), Input / Output Modules (IOMs), Controllers, Network Control Engines, TEC Thermostat Controllers, the variable air volume assemblies (VMAs), are part of the HVAC system to execute the decision made by the manager, as well as to provide and collect information on the basic function of the systems. The purpose of this article is to evaluate student learning at the laboratory course level and to determine the extent to which BAS serves students' learning experience in relation to fundamental concepts. More importantly, the methodology related to the BAS project will be discussed. We discuss the project from students' perspective and experience earned in the areas of design, integration. The methodology used to evaluate the effectiveness of this class in terms of learning outcomes is also described."
