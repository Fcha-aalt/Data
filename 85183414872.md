## Abstract
"Nowadays one of the important tasks in Albania is focusing on performing energy audit in residential buildings in Tirana. This can help to identify energy-saving opportunities and improve overall energy efficiency in residential buildings. Based on it, we have selected an architectural design office which is located close to the lake of Tirana. It is a new building and is constructed in 2009 where the Albanian law doesnâ€™t exist for energy efficiency during this time. In this paper it will be analyzed all the collected data and identify areas where energy-saving measures can be implemented. Afterward the recommendations are based on potential energy savings, cost-effectiveness, and the building owner's goals which includes improving insulation, upgrading windows, optimizing Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems, adopting energy-efficient lighting, and implementing smart home technologies."
