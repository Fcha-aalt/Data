## Abstract
"Energy saving strategies are vital for long term viability and commercial success of buildings. Buildings in the US today consume 41% of the total primary energy. Complex buildings consume significantly higher energy than typical office buildings and present challenges to energy savings due to their operational requirements. This paper presents an economic analysis on energy saving technologies implemented in a complex manufacturing building. The return on investment is determined by using the payback analysis and life cycle cost analysis. The results indicate that energy saving technologies achieved a total energy cost savings of 14%. The savings were achieved by using high efficiency HVAC equipment and advanced fluorescent lighting systems. When applied to similar types of buildings, energy saving strategies considered will increase economic and environmental benefits to owners."
