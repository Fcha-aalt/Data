## Abstract
"Buildings account for nearly 40% of the total energy consumption in the United States, about half of which is used by the HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system. Intelligent scheduling of building HVAC systems has the potential to significantly reduce the energy cost. However, the traditional rule-based and model-based strategies are often inefficient in practice, due to the complexity in building thermal dynamics and heterogeneous environment disturbances. In this work, we develop a data-driven approach that leverages the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique, to intelligently learn the effective strategy for operating the building HVAC systems. We evaluate the performance of our DRL algorithm through simulations using the widely-adopted EnergyPlus tool. Experiments demonstrate that our DRL-based algorithm is more effective in energy cost reduction compared with the traditional rule-based approach, while maintaining the room temperature within desired range."
