## Abstract
"Optimal design of building envelopes/HVAC systems and free cooling strategies are today necessary to reduce energy, economic and environmental impact of telecommunication, electricity distribution, or electric transportations infrastructures. To this aim, designers and operators require advanced techniques and tools. Target of this paper is to present the development of a simulation model for assessing and optimizing cooling performance of new/existing infrastructures to be designed/refurbished from the energy point of view. The model is implemented in a computer tool to assess the related potential benefits of different energy saving technologies/strategies and optimize different objective functions. By the presented approach new design and operating criteria are developed by varying all the occurring boundary conditions (weather, temperature limitations, electricity tariffs, etc.). To show the capability and suitability of the proposed approach, a case study concerning the equipment cooling of a railway substation is developed. The analysis is conducted for different Italian climates, obtaining remarkable energy savings. Specifically, by optimizing free cooling operation and thermal insulation the cooling energy consumption can be decreased up to 80% and 10%, respectively. By an energy refurbishment of all the Italian railway substations an annual electricity cost reduction due to equipment conditioning of about 0.5 M€ can be achieved, 47% lower."
