## Abstract
"HVAC system plays a very important role for the building, as it has captured almost 45â€“50% of the electrical load of any building. This study shows that how we can make sure conventional HVAC to energy-efficient HVAC system. This study also shows that it will also reduce the carbon footprint as electrical load going down."
