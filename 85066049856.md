## Abstract
"Object of this project was the huge renovation on an existing shopping mall in Täby (Sweden) with the aim to drastically cut down the energy consumption and CO2 emissions of the building reducing as much as possible the TEWI (Total Equivalent Warming Impact) of the installation. We proposed to use 2 water cooled oil free centrifugal chillers with R1234ze(E) refrigerant with the double target to reduce direct impact (thanks to the use of HFO) and indirect impact (thanks to the energy efficiency and flexibility of these units). Primarily we optimized the circuit efficiency working on the heat exchangers and unit design according with the thermodynamic properties of R1234ze(E) and secondarily we worked with consultants and designers to enhance the control strategy of the HVAC system through continuous web monitoring of working parameters and performances. A comparative analysis with standard technology is provided."
