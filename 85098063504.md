## Abstract
"The UAE went through a huge building boom in the last twenty years, resulting in extensive useful infrastructure, yet not necessarily all were built with green design parameters in mind. As these buildings reach their retrofitting milestones, it is an opportunity for owners/developers to retrofit the necessary components for improved energy efficiency and reduced carbon footprints. Thus, this paper summarizes the rationale behind the basic elements identified in a study to develop a green retrofitting toolkit for commercial buildings in the United Arab Emirates. The study focused on refurbishing the passive systems, such as the building envelope (wall enclosures and roofs), and the active systems (lighting and HVAC systems). The methodology that was followed involved looking at the purpose of retrofitting a building for each criterion and examining the necessary issues to be considered, as well as providing the optimum solutions along with a performance matrix for the UAE climate in terms of energy and cost savings. Moreover, a Revit based model was used on a prototypical commercial building design to assess the energy efficiency and resultant cost savings. The study emphasized an all-inclusive retrofitting approach."
