## Abstract
"This paper discusses dynamically weighted model predictive control based on two-timescale neurodynamic optimization. Minimax optimization problems with dynamic weights in objective functions are used in the model predictive control. The minimax optimization problems are solved by using a two-timescale neurodynamic optimization approach. Examples on controlling HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning) and CSTR (cooling continuous stirred tank reactor) systems are elaborated to substantiate the efficacy of the control approach."
