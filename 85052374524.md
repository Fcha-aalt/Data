## Abstract
"There are significant results reported in relation to indoor climate and performance of the office work. However, retrofitting of the existing HVAC systems or building envelope may be required in order to ensure good thermal comfort and air quality conditions in buildings and it may increase energy and maintenance costs as well. On the other hand, particular investment might have no effect on office work performance while having major impact on energy performance. This paper deals with assessment of occupant productivity and energy consumption in office buildings by using EP-OP (Energy Performance and Occupant Productivity evaluation) method. Five buildings in Lithuania were selected for the analysis and questionnaire survey of the occupants, thermal comfort measurements as well as energy performance analysis was performed. It revealed significant dissatisfaction by indoor climate which appears in both up-to-date (21%) and old-fashioned (81%) buildings and might lead to productivity losses in the range of 1% to 13%. Results presented in this study confirm that EP-OP method can be used efficiently in order to combine energy performance and human productivity analysis in office buildings."
