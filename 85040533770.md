## Abstract
"Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems account for approximately 55% o f the total energy consumption in buildings. Different types of cooling technologies that integrate solar thermal energy have been explored because of increasing worldwide energy shortage. Latest air-conditioning systems have achieved improved energy efficiency. The application o f solar energy to various types of HVAC systems proved its huge potential for reducing energy usage. However, solar radiation is highly time dependent and fails to meet building demand. In this study, the potential of a 1.5 HP solar assisted air-conditioning system was evaluated by collecting and using real data, including current, voltage, power, and temperature. The application o f the solar-assisted and inverter-type air-conditioning systems was compared for evaluating their performances. The study was conducted in the northern region of Malaysia, specifically Kedah, in a room with the same as that o f a standard office space. Results showed that the average coefficients o f performance of the solar assisted air-conditioning system ranged from 3.00 to 4.45. This range allows for the optimal consumption of electric energy without wastage. Therefore, the solar-assisted air-conditioning system can provide an environmentally friendly alternative to reducing electricity rates."
