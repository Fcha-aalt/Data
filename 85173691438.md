## Abstract
"This paper describes the use of a simple global thermo-physiological skin temperature model of occupants in a vehicle and how to predict multi body segments skin temperatures using Artificial Intelligence (AI). The predictive model was created using a regression study between experimental tests and a thermophysiological mono-segment model based on Gagge's approach[1]."
