## Abstract
"Radiant cooling HVAC systems are widely used at office buildings. Radiant cooling HVAC systems include radiant ceiling systems, radiant floor systems, active chilled beam systems and so on. This study conducted long-term indoor environmental parameters and system operation parameter tests on the office buildings with radiant cooling HVAC systems. Otherwise, the subjective thermal environment comfort survey of the site personnel was made. The HVAC system is evaluated from these two dimensions: indoor environmental parameter and personnel thermal comfort. Summarize the main features and key issues of the operation of the new HVAC system, and make recommendations for the future design of HVAC systems and energy-efficient operation of HVAC systems."
