## Abstract
"The field of energy efficiency in buildings offers challenging opportunities from a control point of view. Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) units in buildings must be accurately controlled so as to ensure the occupants' comfort and reduced energy consumption. While the existing HVAC models consist of only one or a few HVAC components, this work involves the development of a complete HVAC model for one thermal zone. Also, a novel multivariable control strategy based on PI auto-tuning is proposed by combining the aforementioned model with optimization of the desired (time-varying) equilibria. One of the advantages of the proposed PI strategy is the use of time-varying input equilibria and zone setpoint temperature, which can lead to important energy savings. A comparison with a baseline control strategy with constant setpoint temperature is presented: the comparison results show good tracking performance and improved energy efficiency in terms of HVAC energy consumption."
