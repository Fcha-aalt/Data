## Abstract
"In this study, the results of the performance analysis of a WLHP system applied to a large mall building located close to Naples (South Italy) is presented. The investigation was carried out through a purposely developed dynamic simulation model conceived for building-WLHP systems analyses. Through such computer tool, hourly, daily and seasonal system energy, economic and environmental assessments can obtained. For the developed case study the results of the WLHP system optimization procedure are also reported. A comparison of the modeled WLHP system Vs. traditional HVAC ones is also performed. Encouraging energy, economic and environmental results are achieved."
