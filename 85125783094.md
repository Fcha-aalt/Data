## Abstract
"This paper presents the results on the design and performance analysis of an efficient solar house designed for the Solar Decathlon Middle East 2021 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, with the aim of minimizing the energy consumption for the specific UAE climatic conditions, with particular regard to the consistent use of air conditioning throughout the year. The main objective of the project is to design and test the performance of an efficient house using state-of-the-art green and sustainable building design strategies and technologies toward the goal of achieving an energy self-sufficient building powered with solar PV (net zero energy building - balance the energy demand and supply using renewable and clean energy technologies). Detailed building energy performance simulation was performed using the modeling and analysis of Design Builder/Energy Plus software. The sustainable building design strategies include: bio-sustainable cork panels (to highly insulate the envelope of the conditioned volume), highly reflective cool coating of the outer envelope, passive cooling and ventilation, night cooling strategy, high-performance air-conditioning unit, and energy management system to optimize energy consumption. The results include the daily, monthly, and yearly cooling load calculations, comfort conditions, and energy consumptions (cooling, lighting, and equipment) under Dubai weather conditions. The annual electricity intensity of the solar house for both lighting and cooling is 130.9 kWh/m2 (13.4 kWh/m2 for lighting and 117.5 kWh/m2 for cooling)."
