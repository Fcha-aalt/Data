## Abstract
"Hot-water use in hotels and its associated energy use is significant. However, information on hotel hot-water use patterns has been limited until now, resulting in most hotel hotwater systems being designed using extremely old hot-water use data (45 to 80 years old) that predate the introduction of water and energy-efficient fixtures and appliances. In recognition of this fact, ASHRAE funded Research Project RP-1544 \"Establishing Benchmark Levels and Patterns of Commercial Hot-Water Use-Hotels \" to both develop a monitoring methodology that could be duplicated by others to collect hot-water use data from a larger number of hotels and to obtain updated hot-water use information from at least two hotels. This paper builds on information presented in the project final report, the three previously published papers, and a fourth paper released simultaneously with this paper to present information on using the updated data to select water heating systems for hotels of any desired size and compares results of this sizing method to other hotel hotwater system sizing methods described in ASHRAE Handbook-HVAC Applications, Chapter 50, Service Water Heating (ASHRAE 2015) through the use of examples."
