## Abstract
"Buildings are responsible for a large portion of global energy consumption. Therefore, a detailed investigation towards a more effective energy performance of buildings is needed. Building energy performance is mature in terms of parameters related to the buildingsâ€™ physical characteristics, and their attributes are easily collectable. However, the poor ability of emulating reality pertinent to time-dependent parameters, such as occupancy parameters, may result in large discrepancies between estimated and actual energy consumption. Although efforts are being made to minimize energy waste in buildings by applying different control strategies based on occupancy information, new practices should be examined to achieve fully smart buildings by providing more realistic occupancy models to reflect their energy usage. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the methods for collection and application of occupancy-related parameters affecting total building energy consumption. Different occupancy-based control strategies are investigated with emphasis on heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and lighting systems. The advantages and limitations of existing methods are outlined to identify the gaps for future research."
