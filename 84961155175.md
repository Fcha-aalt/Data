## Abstract
"Tucson is located in the heart of the Sonoran desert in the southwest region of the United States; a unique hot arid climate. The authors have been developing a residence for Eng. Craig Blackman; a Tucson advocate for energy efficiency and sustainability. This paper describes implementations of theories and principles that supported research, development, and optimization of the residence's schematic design. It also demonstrates the applied energy and cost savings strategies. To optimize the energy efficient basecase design, and to achieve the pre Net-Zero + status, four additional passive and active environmental systems have been implemented after approved by the homeowner. These are 1) high performance windows, 2) cool roof technology, 3) thermal mass materials, and 4) High Efficiency HVAC. The research team presented to the homeowner the pre Net-Zero strategies and how they have been integrated to the design with a detailed description of the human thermal and visual comfort. To achieve the Net-Zero + status, three major environmental systems have been integrated; 1) hydronic radiant floor slabs, 2) solar domestic water heater, and 2) photovoltaics. The energy savings and cost savings of each will be explained and presented and the whole building performance will be demonstrated through computer energy simulation using ENERGY-101 software. As a result, the residence's total area of 3, 190 ft2 consumed an annual 37, 558 kWh at the cost of $4, 135. The energy saving strategies indicated a 73.1% or $2, 572 annual operating cost while a 100% savings has been achieved in the Net-Zero + status. The outcome of this research is intended to be shared and disseminated to all Arizonans, and developers across hot dry arid regions of the world."
