## Abstract
"This paper gives an overview of what the airports and terminals at TAV Holding is doing as far as energy efficiency is concerned. The efforts at TAV consist of small incremental projects (addition of insulations, automatic door installation, performance improvements at cooling, heating, etc.) and big projects (Photovoltaic panels, Trigen, etc.). The building structure of the terminals is the main parameter in defining project outlines. Beside terminal structure, there are also other parameters that are affecting the energy performance of the building. By the cooperation with universities, thermal camera analyses had been carried out to detect the thermal insulation efficiency at the terminal shell. Customer satisfaction is the main parameter in terms of passenger comfort in terminal for aviation services. For this purpose, projects were carried out to decrease operational energy consumptions related to HVAC systems and thereby increase in passenger satisfaction. The most energy consuming system in terminals is the HVAC system with the percentage of 60 of the overall energy consumption. Thermal stratification system was implemented in a lounge area in one terminal. All projects had been analyzed for their payback period."
