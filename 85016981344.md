## Abstract
"Hands-free phone calling is the most frequently utilized feature for vehicles equipped with infotainment systems and external microphones which support connection to phones and implement automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, achieving high in-vehicle hands-free phone call quality is challenging due to the extremely noisy nature of a vehicle's interior environment. Noise generated by wind, mechanical and structural sources, tire to road contact, passenger cross-Talk, engine/exhaust systems, and HVAC air pressure and flow are all significant contributors to deterioration of hands-free phone call quality. In addition, other factors influencing the in-vehicle phone call quality include microphone placement, cabin acoustics, seat position of the talker, and the noise reduction algorithm of the hands-free system. In this paper, we present results of a study involving over 200 vehicles from a broad range of OEMs and vehicle segments which seeks to quantify the impact of different noise sources (particularly road and HVAC noise) on the quality of hands-free phone calling. We demonstrate that, even though the vehicles studied utilized different noise reduction / signal processing methods and demonstrated unique noise spectral characteristics for the conditions considered, some general relationships between noise level and call quality can nonetheless be observed and quantified with respect to the aggregate performance of the systems. Subsequently, we chose a single vehicle to evaluate the performance of two different suppliers' noise reduction processing capabilities. In this case, the background noise was systematically varied in level to understand the relationship between background noise level and phone call quality when the noise reduction processing and noise spectral content are controlled. The learnings generated from these studies provide a basis by which engineers can establish in-cabin vehicle noise level targets which would result in acceptable hands-free phone call quality. In addition, these processes can be used to quantify the effectiveness of a hands-free system's noise reduction processing under various noise conditions. Finally, we demonstrate that these methods can also be extended to quantifying the performance of in-vehicle automatic speech recognition. In this case, we demonstrate that word error rate (WER) is also influenced in a systematic fashion by background noise level."
