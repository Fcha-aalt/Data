## Abstract
"In this paper, we create a highly accurate and portable occupancy monitoring system leveraging LIDAR and PIR sensors. Using data gathered from this system, we develop a Markov Chain model to predict transitions and further improve accuracy. The system is able to with near 100% accuracy detect occupant movements through an area. Compared to more permanently installed sensors, the proposed approach offers a more flexible, portable sensing solution. This system can be readily deployed with minimal training data, benefiting applications such as building scheduling, usage design, security, and retail analytics."
