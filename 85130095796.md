## Abstract
"Since the World Health Organization announced the COVID-19 pandemic, indoor airflows became a synonym for virus super-spreaders and the focus point for the scientific community and professional associations across the globe, disrupting all daily life dimensions. Europe's quick response to control the disease led the REHVA board to address mitigation guidelines, reassessed by each member association's following national specifics. The present study aims to quantify the energy consumption and CO2 emissions of “large office” buildings in top-five European economies under the COVID-19 guidelines under the post-pandemic telework forecast. Methodology resorted to a standard model under Building Energy Simulation assessment to compare prior and posterior scenarios. The latter displays a tendency to increase energy and CO2 emissions in all locations, in the first form 10.18% (Rome) to 69.48% (Paris); and second 5.80% (Rome) and 120.61% (Paris), which will affect national energy production and imports, urban pollution and business competitiveness. On a different scope, future HVAC guidelines need to address the incoming figures, particularly in highly dense urban areas. Also, to comply with the goals set by the Paris Accord."
