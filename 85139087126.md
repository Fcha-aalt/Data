## Abstract
"Due to fast progress in information technologies and long lifecycles of vehicles, there are ever-increasing expectations in modern automotive software development regarding the flexibility to integrate updates and new functions quickly into already existing systems. This paper proposes a process, that is especially suitable for the development of new functions in higher programming languages and the usage of machine learning models. When developed in a tool like MATLAB, code generators can be used to integrate the function step-by-step into a service-oriented automotive E/E-architecture. It is based on a classic V-model process and uses integration steps according to the XiL approach. The key aspect is the frontloading of verification and validation into the steps as early as possible to keep iteration cycles fast. The proposed process is applied to the development of a Neural Network Model Predictive Control (NNMPC) for a Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) unit of a city bus. The resulting NNMPC is then integrated into a system based on the AUTOSAR adaptive platform. That allowed the function to be developed and integrated quickly and seems to be a promising approach to bring new functions into already existing automotive E/E-architectures."
