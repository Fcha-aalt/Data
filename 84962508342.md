## Abstract
"The implementation of energy efficiency measures, as well as the integration of renewable energy systems, are challenging tasks on the road towards the Low or Zero Energy Buildings (ZEB). This is even more the case, when considering intensively energy consuming buildings, amongst them hotels and touristic lodgings, especially when they operate in intensively seasonally visited regions, such as the Mediterranean. Even when applying the fundamentals of energy efficient design of buildings to a hotel, like the implementation of sound sun-protection schemes, the use of thermal insulation, and the use of efficient Heating Ventilating Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems, there is a significant demand for sanitary hot water, as well as for warm water for purposes like swimming pools that has to be covered. This can be ideally done by means of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) with solar thermal systems being a primary candidate, as they meet the range of temperature requirements and feature a proven efficiency, reliability and durability. For over thirty years now, solar thermal systems have been applied in hotel buildings in Greece, mostly with success, although failures were also part of the learning procedure. It is therefore of interest to present the current situation of solar thermal systems applications in the hotel sector and to review the state of the art of large scale solar thermal systems, in order to be able to determine future challenges."
