## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 77 papers. The topics discussed include: long-term electricity market agent based model validation using genetic algorithm based optimization; Pareto-optimal energy sharing between battery-equipped renewable generators; small-scale communities are sufficient for cost- and data-efficient peer-to-peer energy sharing; MARCO - multi-agent reinforcement learning based control of building HVAC systems; towards federated learning for HVAC analytics: a measurement study; the long-term cost of energy generation; automated classification of power plants by generation type; flexible redundancy generation for virtual network embedding with an application to smart grids; fairness in power flow network congestion management with outer matching and principal notions of fair division; and FlexAbility - modeling and maximizing the bidirectional flexibility availability of unidirectional charging of large pools of electric vehicles."
