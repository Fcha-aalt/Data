## Abstract
"Smart dispatch strategy on intermittent renewable power supply, with high spatiotemporal matching with stochastic energy demand, is of great significance to reduce the requirement for energy storages and diversified energy conversions, together with mitigated import/export pressure on power grids. The application of artificial intelligence in renewable energy dispatch with predicted thermodynamic and energy performances, can improve the flexibility, reliability and stability of the power system. In this chapter, a holistic overview on machine learning (ML) applications in building energy demand prediction is conducted, in respect to cooling, heating, and electrical energy systems. The underlying mechanism is studied for ML to characterize dynamic behaviors of nonlinear systems. Based on the predicted energy demands, flexible demand-side management strategies have been reviewed, including smart appliances, HVAC systems, plug-in loads, and storages. Last but not least, a generic approach is proposed for advanced controllers, including dynamic performance prediction, a machine learning-based surrogate model, controller strategies, and control objectives. This chapter can promote the application of ML for the development of hybrid demand-side controllers for energy flexible buildings."
