## Abstract
"Information technology equipment (ITE) continues to keep pace with the rate of change of software and the feature rich services they provide. ITE consists of several very distinct types of hardware, each with their own unique designs and functions for supporting different types of data and services. The ITE is divided into these basic functions, servers, networking and storage. The role of servers has grown immensely through the years to meet the demands, and through specialization, servers may achieve higher degrees of throughput, speed and energy efficiency. Networking is the way servers are connected to other servers, other resources, and to the world outside the data center. Based on the size and design of the data center, network implementations may take any forms. Networking equipment may also be classified based on an abstraction of its function within the data center, using the open system interconnection (OS) seven layer model. A third major component of ITE within data centers is for the purpose of storing data, which is typically stored for reasons such as archival purpose, disaster recovery, easily accessible, and backup purpose. By understanding the fundamental roles of ITE, its changes, and how it interacts with the data center HVAC, data center designers will be better equipped to handle this changing landscape."
