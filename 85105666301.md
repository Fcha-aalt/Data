## Abstract
"This study evaluates the potential of thermal comfort and energy consumption enhancement in a modern office building with high ratio of glazed fa√ßade and a heating / cooling system with high thermal inertia. Application of proper control strategies for HVAC systems is important to prevent overheating, overcooling and excessive energy consumption. In this paper, the effect of various control settings and strategies on the thermal comfort is studied. The study is performed on a validated simulation model for a representative thermal zone located in a real administrative building, called the Energetikum."
