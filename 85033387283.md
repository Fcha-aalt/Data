## Abstract
"Chiller sequencing control is a vital function for the feasible and energy-efficient operation of multiple-chiller plant in a centralized HVAC system. Various control strategies have been developed and applied to achieve overall energy efficiency of chiller plant with guarantying sufficient cooling for indoor thermal comfort. However, these control strategies suffer from various uncertainties and usually fail to achieve the expected control and/or energy performance. Therefore, this study presents a robustness analysis of chiller sequencing control in order to understand the robustness of the typical control strategies under uncertainties. Based on the robustness analysis, a simple and applicable control method is developed to enhance the robustness and reliability of chiller sequencing control under uncertainties."
