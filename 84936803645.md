## Abstract
"This paper discusses the feasibility of shedding electrical demand associated with passenger coach HVAC systems during periods of peak traction needs, with the goal of rightsizing the main engine on a passenger locomotive, and possibly eliminating the HEP. In this study, train operation simulations were conducted to determine the sustained durations of peak traction needs on typical commuter and long distance routes. The simulation results were combined with thermal analyses of a sample passenger coach to investigate whether the required comfortable temperature range could be maintained for the durations of peak traction needs, with the HVAC system deactivated. Additionally, a review of available technology for load-shedding, and an economic analysis were conducted to evaluate the feasibility of implementing load shedding on passenger trains. The study showed that an appropriate load shedding strategy can be implemented without adversely impacting the industrywide passenger comfort standards and eliminating the capital and maintenance costs associated with an HEP."
