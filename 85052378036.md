## Abstract
"Thermal losses and Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system play a significant role in thermal performance of buildings that is reflected in energy consumption and associated energy cost, respectively. There are different ways of solving these problems including retrofitting and conduction calculations of thermal protection of the buildings. However, the parameters affecting the energy performance of buildings should be addressed during early design stages. This is why energy modeling is a widely used tool for predicting energy use of buildings and applying various energy-saving measures. This paper presents a case study of modeling a school buildingâ€™s energy behavior in Astana city considering its weather conditions and costs of energy sources. The use of three different systems, FCU, CAV, and mechanical ventilation with central heating, and RES application are considered and compared in TAS simulation software. It adopts a holistic approach to evaluate energy consumption, potential of renewable sources, thermal comfort, building orientation, and financial feasibility, as well as to make a set of recommendations toward improving energy efficiency and design solutions."
