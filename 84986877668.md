## Abstract
"As we grow more aware of the role of occupants in reducing the environmental footprint of commercial buildings, we also see many factors that are changing how occupant workplaces are being designed: A technologically savvy millennial generation, more telecommuting, more short-term contract workers, and more teamwork and collaboration in the workplace are creating a new set of needs and expectations. A 2015 study by JLL of 700 corporate real estate executives (CREs) found that 61 % of them expect to make modifications to corporate offices in response to these new realities. Their objective: to increase productivity by reducing space per person, and addressing employee health, comfort and wellbeing, and to create a \"green workplace.\" Unfortunately, there is much confusion as to how this should be done effectively. For example, over 70 % of knowledge workers work in open office environments with space allocation per person steadily declining [1]. While this supports communications and teamwork, it can be disastrous for individual tasks requiring concentration. There has also been confusing flurry of misleading literature that green offices are automatically more productive, followed by recent studies that dismiss this as being too simplistic. For example, reducing the space that is heated, cooled and lighted can produce energy savings, but it can adversely affect productivity if employees are packed like sardines without attention to noise, visual comfort, privacy and amenities. Reducing HVAC levels to save energy can hamper work output if employees are too hot or too cold. The aim of a green + productive workplace is to achieve a balance: an office that is sustainable and energy efficient, and which also provides a comfortable physical environment where employees can do their best work, support business goals and want to stay with the organization - in short, an office that is more productive."
