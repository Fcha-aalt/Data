## Abstract
"Hospitality sector consumes tremendous amount of energy to meet the needs of guests. There are many benefits of an energy-efficient hotel, which includes greater guest comfort, extended life of equipment, lower operating costs and cleaner environment, over above because of saving from energy the significant financial rewards. To increase the energy efficiency of a building operation, there has to be a proper plan in place. Installation of building automation system is the most important aspect of that plan. Building automation system of a hotel building includes a wide range of services, but lighting and HVAC systems need special attention because they play the most important roles, both in energy efficiency and guest comfort. There are a number of control methods and networking technologies available for automation of various services. This paper presents design concepts of hotel building automation aimed at providing high energy efficiency with maximum guest comfort by using various methods and technologies judicially."
