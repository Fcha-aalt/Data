## Abstract
"Phase change materials (PCMs) are substances that can change their phase at a specific range of temperatures. This is the case in the temperature range and in the event that there is a brief gap between the supply of a particular quantity of energy and the demand for that quantity, these materials come in quite helpful. As a result, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) for the military, as well as waste heat recovery and thermal management. The simulation result of this proposed method is developed using Matlab and Simulink, the user is classified using a fuzzy logic control which helps to improve the energy consumption patterns which are they exhibit. Using this proposed method, we can perform several modes of operations which are toogled between the control, which achieves more amount of greater flexibility, also at same time it helps to reduce the usage of number of switches which are placed between various OMâ€™s. This is demonstrated by the fact that the fuzzy logic control is used. Therefore, the developed control logic reveals a promising potential for boosting the energy efficiency. We achieve nearly 85% of accuracy as a result which are very higher than comparing with the several existing methods."
