## Abstract
"The aim of this paper is to explore the contribution of ecolabel HVAC systems, which are already available in the market, to the energy upgrade of existing dwellings, placing emphasis on whether they can constitute an efficient means of dealing with energy poverty. For this reason, the effects of these systems, when placed on an existing detached dwelling, are considered not only in relationship to energy savings, but also with other energy, environmental, social and economic criteria. Comparison is made between scenarios of the energy upgrade with various ecolabel HVAC systems, as well as scenarios of the energy upgrade of the building envelope. A parametric analysis is carried out, regarding the aforementioned criteria in the four climatic zones of Greece and three building typologies. Scenarios are prioritised, using the Multi-Attribute Utility Theory. Based on this analysis, conclusions are drawn, concerning the most advantageous energy saving actions, from an energy, environmental, social and economic point of view, for each building type and climatic zone. It is found that certain synergies of ecolabel HVAC systems with RES systems can be effective energy saving solutions, capable to face energy poverty."
