## Abstract
"In this letter, we propose two novel methods for four-class motor imagery (MI) classification using electroencephalography (EEG). Also, we developed a real-time health 4.0 (H4.0) architecture for brain-controlled internet of things (IoT) enabled environments (BCE), which uses the classified MI task to assist disabled persons in controlling IoT-enabled environments such as lighting and heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC). The first method for classification involves a simple and low-complex classification framework using a combination of regularized Riemannian mean (RRM) and linear SVM. Although this method performs better compared to state-of-the-art techniques, it still suffers from a nonnegligible misclassification rate. Hence, to overcome this, the second method offers a persistent decision engine (PDE) for the MI classification, which improves classification accuracy (CA) significantly. The proposed methods are validated using an in-house recorded four-class MI data set (data set I, collected over 14 subjects), and a four-class MI data set 2a of BCI competition IV (data set II, collected over 9 subjects). The proposed RRM architecture obtained average CAs of 74.30% and 67.60% when validated using datasets I and II, respectively. When analyzed along with the proposed PDE classification framework, an average CA of 92.25% on 12 subjects of data set I and 82.54% on 7 subjects of data set II is obtained. The results show that the PDE algorithm is more reliable for the classification of four-class MI and is also feasible for BCE applications. The proposed low-complex BCE architecture is implemented in real time using Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ along with the Virgo EEG data acquisition system. The hardware implementation results show that the proposed system architecture is well suited for body-wearable devices in the scenario of Health 4.0. We strongly feel that this study can aid in driving the future scope of BCE research."
