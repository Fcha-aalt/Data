## Abstract
"Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) account for a large proportion of energy consumption. Improving the energy efficiency of HVAC and utilizing increased amounts of renewable energy are effective strategies for achieving decarbonization. While thermal storage is one of the key technologies that solves a renewable energy issue that has the temporal and geographical gaps between supply and demand, operation planning using optimization methods, such as model predictive control, is important owing to the complexity of the system. A prediction model with high accuracy and low computational load is required because the performance of model predictive control typically depends on it. Further, to facilitate its extensive use in common buildings, it is necessary to develop a simple modeling method that requires no expertise. This study proposes a framework based on a dual-structured optimization process as a modeling method to create a prediction model. This method was applied to an actual small-scale office building. It was confirmed that such a model which accurately predicts up to 24 h ahead within approximately 1 s can be created.1"
