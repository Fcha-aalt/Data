## Abstract
"Simulation models and predictive tools need to be fast, accurate and robust at the same time. The models that have to provide numerical solutions under transient conditions for a long period of time need to be simple with the aim of minimizing the time respond, without losing the accuracy. Thus, previous experimental data and a calibration methodology are necessary to assure this objective, both are strictly necessary to reproduce the behaviour with accuracy expected. Consequently, even accurate information (e.g. look-up tables) for HVAC&R components (e.g. heat exchangers, fan/compressor, auxiliary elements, etc.) is known and all coupling system is developed, the minimization of experimental tests for calibration purposed based scattered data interpolation is now an important aspect, which looks for reducing the quantity of experiments necessary to assure the accuracy expected from an optimization point of view. The present work shows an optimization procedure based on test number minimization according detailed error comparison against existing previous data. Illustrative results for a specific component are presented highlighting test number reduction without losing accuracy."
