## Abstract
"The UN Sustainable Development Goals include 7. Affordable and Clean Energy For All and 13. Urgent Action to Combat Climate Change. To help achieve these goals utilities have been required to fund energy audits and subsidize energy improvements. These improvements are typically looked at in isolation. The application of Industrial and Systems Engineering tools can increase the impact of these investments. Think about a building as a system, and the energy equipment within it as subsystems. If we understand how each subsystem works and its interaction with other subsystems, there is a greater opportunity to optimize the system and identify potential energy savings. HVAC, lighting, water heating, and the building's envelope, are all part of the building energy system. The way they function depends highly on exterior variables, such as temperature and humidity. How can the system be optimized to work efficiently while achieving good indoor air quality and human comfort? Based on personal experience, this paper intends to share with the audience ways in which systems engineering tools can be applied to a building's energy efficiency."
