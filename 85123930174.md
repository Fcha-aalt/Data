## Abstract
"The office environment related to thermal comfort is essential in developing the workspace for high productivity, energy-saving, and global warming reduction. This paper deals with a comprehensive literature review on the thermal comfort for office buildings focusing on the state of arts of adaptive solutions, control methods, prospective of the workers, advanced technologies, and energy efficiency toward green office buildings. An analysis of research methods implemented during recent years was conducted to determine and assess the temperature comfort is explained. Indoor comfort environment, selection and requirements of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, and electrical lighting installation improvement are also discussed. The review concludes that the win-win situation between green office occupants' comfort and the adaptive energy-saving solution effectively increases productivity and energy efficiency, respectively. This review contributes a critical analysis of the gap for the existing solutions, control methods, and technologies and provides suggestions and recommendations that will hopefully strengthen the efforts towards the development of comfortable indoor temperature in the green office buildings for future applications."
