## Abstract
"It is widely known that increasing outdoor air ventilation rates in buildings can help improve indoor air quality and mitigate the spread of diseases. However, cooling and dehumidifying outdoor air requires significantly more energy than treating indoor recirculated air. Recent developments in water vapor-selective membranes, which use a vapor partial pressure gradient to remove water vapor from air, offer a unique opportunity to provide highly efficient dehumidification in HVAC systems that can justify high outdoor air ventilation rates without drastic increases in energy consumption. This work presents an analysis of a novel membrane HVAC system referred to as the Active Membrane Energy Exchanger (AMX), which couples a refrigeration cycle with selective membranes to simultaneously cool and dehumidify air. While past selective membrane dehumidification systems have been isothermal, the AMX is the first to deliberately target non-isothermal operation by combining membrane dehumidification and active heat exchange. A thermodynamic model is developed for the AMX in a system that uses both outdoor air ventilation and indoor air recirculation (AMX-R) to elucidate the limitations around increasing ventilation rates. This study is among the first to consider recirculation for selective membrane processes, rather than only 100% outdoor air. The AMX-R can achieve up to 50% cooling and dehumidification electricity savings in warm and humid climates under current ventilation standards. Furthermore, ventilation rates can be nearly tripled with the AMX-R while consuming similar amounts of energy as conventional HVAC systems. Lastly, the incorporation of EnergyPlus building simulations for 114 US cities shows that the AMX-R has the greatest potential in the southern regions of the US."
