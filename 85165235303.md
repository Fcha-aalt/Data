## Abstract
"In a competitive environment, organisations are focusing on the energy-efficient smart system to reduce the expenses related to energy consumption and a comprehensive literature survey shows that windows are significant sources of heat and light in an enclosed space, which increases the load on air conditioner systems to maintain the comfortable conditions inside the room. There is a need to develop IoT enabled smart window for controlling heat and light in this context. In this study, suitable devices and sensors are identified based on a systematic literature survey to develop the IoT-enabled smart window. The experimental setup is also developed to evaluate the heat flow and luminosity inside the closed room. It has been observed that the maximum temperature recorded in the room in the range of 29–30°C and results shows saving in electricity by 11 watts/hour. This study concluded that low variation is observed in the indoor lumen and temperature conditions using the PDLC film. The movements of the PDLC crystals were controlled using mobile-based technology to make the film’s operation feasible and accurate. A mobile application for managing the film is found highly viable and reliable to operate."
