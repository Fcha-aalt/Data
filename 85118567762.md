## Abstract
"Indirect evaporative cooling (IEC) and heat recovery are key technologies for decarbonising heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) while their performance is affected by the ambient environment. This paper presents a numerical investigation of a recently developed hybrid ventilator integrating the IEC and heat recovery. A TRNSYS-Matlab model was used to evaluate the ventilator's adaptability (operational and energy performance) in a public building at five typical cities in China. According to the validated model analysis, the ventilator shows a superior adaptability to the temperate region, with the lowest annual energy use at 96.70 kWh/m2 and the minimum energy input of the auxiliary source at 39.29% of the total energy use. The hybrid ventilator's adaptability is followed by the hot summer cold winter region and cold region where the ventilator covers 85% of the total heating/cooling loads in transition seasons. The severe cold region and hot summer warm winter region requires a significant auxiliary energy use for the stable indoor air parameters, which consumes 70.64% and 60.1% of the annual energy use, respectively. Future works are to improve the performance of the IEC and heat pump unit in the two climatic regions for better adaptability of the ventilator."
