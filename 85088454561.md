## Abstract
"This paper deals with adaptation of Biomimicry strategies in building to make it environmentally sustainable. Biomimicry is the innovative approach which emulates the design principles of Flora and fauna as the genesis of the design. The approach is studied in context with the objectives of green building viz., Indoor air quality, Water efficiency, Energy efficiency and eco-friendly HVAC system. The study investigates the potential of emulating Biomimicry approach in green building technology. In this paper it is discussed that how the Biomimicry approach innovatively solves the purpose of green building, i.e. Resource efficiency and reduce environmental impact of the building."
