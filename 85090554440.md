## Abstract
"The adoption of highly efficient vapour-compression heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration (HVAC&R) systems is compulsory to achieve a low-carbon society. Expansion work recovery using a two-phase ejector is widely recognized as one of the most promising measures to improve the energy efficiency of HVAC&R units. This holds true for all operation conditions provided that an effective capacity control technique is implemented. In this work a thorough critical review on the current status of the presently available capacity control strategies for two-phase ejectors was carried out. In addition, their pros and cons as well as the comparison of their performance were reported. It was concluded that two-phase ejectors can be properly capacity controlled in large- and medium-scale vapour-compression units. However, a suitable capacity control mechanism for small-scale vapour-compression solutions still requires a major breakthrough and is being intensively discussed among experts in the field."
