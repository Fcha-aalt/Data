## Abstract
"Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) is the largest source of energy consumption, they are one of the fields most concerned by the energy efficiency. In this research and in order to create a new, ecological and more sustainable market, we took as case of study an office building located in Rabat Morocco. We initiated a study for the latter on the development of High Energy Efficiency Buildings (HEEB) to be able to contribute to the reduction of electrical energy consumption. The objective of this article, is to establish a manual heat balance by considering external and internal heat sources and the number of occupancy on a typical area of the building studied, to validate the results already obtained by a software program for calculating the cooling loads, which will allow us to judge the technical and economic feasibility of integrating a new solar cooling technology instead of conventional technologies."
