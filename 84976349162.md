## Abstract
"Recent technological advancements have enabled energy efficiency building through automation, equipment upgrade, and material improvement. These enhancements are mostly focused on centrally controllable units such as HVAC, lighting systems, and equipment, while miscellaneous energy loads (e.g., plug loads) that are mostly controlled by occupants, are not as efficiently managed. Various energy rating systems, such as LEED, grade the mechanical and electrical equipment in buildings. However, the fact that people spend more than 90% of their time indoors, suggests a great opportunity to help buildings reach a higher level of efficiency by monitoring and quantifying occupants' energy-use. In this paper, we review the existing literature on occupant energy efficiency programs in residential and commercial buildings, and benchmark the potential of such programs to impact LEED rating systems. The main contribution of this paper is comparing the current occupant energy efficiency programs' potential against standard industry measures (i.e., LEED). The results report a possible potential impact for residential building occupant energy efficiency, while indicating the lack of adequate reference and reliable measurement for the commercial sector. The details of the methodology, data analysis, and results are discussed in the paper along with future avenues of occupant-oriented energy efficiency research."
