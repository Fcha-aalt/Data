## Abstract
"Because of irreversibility on building construction, building energy efficiency design is more depended on simulation technology. Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of China (MOHURD) also stated that China's building energy consumption accounted for 27.5% of the total energy consumption in 2012. Energy consumption is simulated based on the heat transfer principle of building wall, windows, roof and ventilation. Improved measurements are proposed for simulation cases. The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) energy consumption of benchmark and energy efficiency building are simulated based on EnergyPlus software. The most effective energy-saving measurements of energy efficiency building are improving air-conditioning system performance and thermal properties of wall and window. The results show that the Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) of refrigeration system should be more than 3 and energy-saving ratio is about 30%. Heat transfer coefficient of wall and window should be less than 1.0W路m-2路k-1 and 2.0W路m-2路k-1, the energy-saving ratio is more than 16% and 10% respectively. The sum energy-saving ratios of refrigeration system, wall and window are about 56%. The energy efficiency ratios of roof and air exchanges number are not very obvious. Some energy-saving technologies with high cost are put forward based on simulation results which provide effective ways for building energy efficiency in Guangdong province, China."
