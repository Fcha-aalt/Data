## Abstract
"This paper develops a continual deep reinforcement relearning (RL) controller for large buildings that exhibit non-stationary behaviors. The non-stationarity in building operations caused by unexpected changes in weather patterns, occupancy, and faults, makes it imperative to develop control algorithms that adapt to the changing conditions. Given the slow time constants in building operations, we assume that the non-stationarity can be modeled as discrete transitions between stationary models of system behavior. We address the challenge of detecting transitions between stationary processes using trend analysis, and relearn control policies that accommodate the tradeoff between energy savings and comfort after such transitions occur. We demonstrate our approach on a \"smart building test-bed\"for developing data-driven HVAC controllers that are deployed in large buildings on our university campus."
