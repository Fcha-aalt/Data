## Abstract
"Nowadays, global warming, environment pollution, and limitations in energy resources have appeared as a serious global crisis. Therefore, energy efficiency and energy conservation are necessary in all energy-consuming devices, such as heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. The aims of this project are to evaluate the performance and energy conservation of a conventional air conditioning system and also compare its performance with the proposed HVAC system, which consists of a heat recovery unit to reduce the initial capital cost and electricity consumption of the system. Through hour-by-hour simulations, the annual energy consumptions of these two systems have to be calculated and analysed. A CO2-based demand controlled ventilation strategy offers a great opportunity to reduce additional energy consumption in the above HVAC systems, while providing the required ventilation."
