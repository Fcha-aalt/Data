## Abstract
"Currently, the increasing tightness cladding of buildings, which generally corresponds with the need for energy efficiency in buildings. Microclimate of the buildings is stable and almost changeless owing to the exterior climate. The tightness of building envelopes poses problems in terms of growth of CO2 and other pollutants inside buildings, which can affect not only using the appropriate installation HVAC (ventilation), but also by plants located in the building. The contribution presents the results of measurements of CO2 in summer 2014 in the interior of experimental passive house at the Faculty of Civil Engineering, VSB – Technical University of Ostrava."
