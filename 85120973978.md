## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 78 papers. The topics discussed include: learning-based framework for sensor fault-tolerant building HVAC control with model-assisted learning; learn to chill - intelligent chiller scheduling using meta-learning and deep reinforcement learning; activity-aware privacy protection for smart water meters; holistic energy awareness for intelligent drones; QUILT: quantify, infer and label the thermal efficiency of heating and cooling residential homes; cs-light: camera sensing based occupancy-aware robust smart building lighting control; energy-efficient parking analytics system using deep reinforcement learning; can I go for a roof walk today? know your housingâ€™s air quality from a thermo-hygrometer; and the space broker: a middleware for mediating interactions in smart IoT spaces."
