## Abstract
"Control of building energy systems offers high potential for energy savings. In this field, self-organizing model-based control agents are particularly promising: each of these agents controls only one small subsystem and aims to optimize its performance by interacting with its neighbors. This interaction requires a dynamic exchange of the variables coupling the subsystems to obtain a global optimum in the total system. Previous work has demonstrated the efficacy of various exchange mechanisms assuming simplifications such as convexity or availability of all physical equations and price signals. As these assumptions may not hold in many building use cases, we identified the need to develop an agent design that overcomes these limitations by minimizing the required information exchange and allowing arbitrary model types. We thus develop and analyze an agent design, in which each agent assumes a certain probability distribution of the dynamic inputs it expects to receive from its neighbors. Using the machine learning techniques Genetic Programming and Random Forest classification, each agent is able to classify its control decision and predict the costs that are probably related to it. The costs contain irreversible entropy production and relative information entropy, which considers how well the agents align their expectations. Judging from the results of a building energy case study, the control system design is feasible and could ensure efficient operation without the need for extensive development effort in building energy systems."
