## Abstract
"Retrofit fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) products are undergoing major advances in their ability to optimize the operation and maintenance of building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems as a result of advances in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and low-cost sensor networks. However, many market barriers still exist to their widespread adoption. This paper is the first to study the market and barriers for FDD products from the perspective of early adopters of HVAC rooftop retrofit FDD products as part of a field study of early adopters. Researchers engaged multiple sites and installed different FDD products at these sites for the purposes of (1) evaluating market readiness, market barriers, and user experience, (2) evaluating energy and demand savings, (3) evaluating the purchase, installation, training, and use process, and (4) determining overall FDD product effectiveness. This paper presents and focuses on the market study goals, methods, results, and findings determined based on survey data collected from key stakeholders participating in the study. These stakeholders included FDD providers, energy efficiency program managers and engineers, HVAC contractors, building owners, facility managers, energy managers, and consultants. The study provides results and analyses concerning (1) current knowledge and awareness levels for FDD technologies, (2) attitudes towards FDD products, (3) market barriers and resources available for FDD, and (4) insights on how stakeholders perceive and determine the value and cost for purchasing, using, and adopting FDD technologies and products. The study produced twelve (12) key findings, which provide valuable input for energy efficiency programs in their development of more effective FDD marketing programs that can increase adoption of FDD technologies and reduce barriers to widespread adoption."
