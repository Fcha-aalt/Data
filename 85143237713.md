## Abstract
"As evaluation tools and methods for the Building Energy Efficiency Rating (BEER) are different from those of international green building certification such as LEED, the performance of the same energy efficient measure for the same building can differ significantly per certification. This study intends to identify what energy efficiency measures are more advantageous for which building energy performance certification by evaluating primary energy saving measures that are applied to a real building already certified by BEER and LEED. Considering that the required insulation and airtightness of a building envelope over the last decade have already been at a high standard, clients might not be willing to agree to a smaller fenestration ratio. Additionally, the reduction of energy demands by building envelope measures does not seem to be easily obtainable. Therefore, installing high-efficiency HVAC&R systems and introducing renewable energy systems would be a more effective strategy for both BEER and LEED. Specifically, efficient HVAC&R systems and PVs are more advantageous in achieving LEED credits. However, ground source heat pumps and fuel cells have led to less LEED credits, while they are more advantageous in raising the BEER grade."
