## Abstract
"Controlling heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) to improve its energy efficiency or implement ancillary services (e.g., demand response or frequency regu- lation) requires compensating for occupants and the computers/equipment they use, which significantly impact the thermal dynamics of buildings. Several studies have explored the use of either binary models or online learning for occupancy within model predictive control (MPC) frameworks, but the use of more fine-grained predictive models for occupancy has been less well-studied. This paper uses real data from an HVAC testbed to develop predictive models of occupancy and heating load, evaluate the predictive accuracy of the occupancy model, and then quantity its efficacy in achieving energy reductions in conjunction with a learning-based MPC (LBMPC) controller. We conclude by conducting a simulation study to determine the optimal horizon for an LBMPC controller. In particular, we find there is a trade-off with increasing the horizon length between decreasing prediction accuracy of occupancy heating load and the ability of the MPC to better anticipate thermal dynamics due to occupancy and weather."
