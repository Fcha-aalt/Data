## Abstract
"Developing personalised thermal comfort models to inform occupant-centric controls (OCC) in buildings requires collecting large amounts of real-time occupant preference data. This process can be highly intrusive and labour-intensive for large-scale implementations, limiting the practicality of real-world OCC implementations. To address this issue, this study proposes a thermal preference-based HVAC control framework enhanced with Active Learning (AL) to address the data challenges related to real-world implementations of such OCC systems. The proposed AL approach proactively identifies the most informative thermal conditions for human annotation and iteratively updates a supervised thermal comfort model. The resulting model is subsequently used to predict the occupants’ thermal preferences under different thermal conditions, which are integrated into the building’s HVAC controls. The feasibility of our proposed AL-enabled OCC was demonstrated in an EnergyPlus simulation of a real-world testbed supplemented with the thermal preference data of 58 study occupants. The preliminary results indicated a significant reduction in overall labelling effort (i.e., 31.0%) between our AL-enabled OCC and conventional OCC while still achieving a slight increase in energy savings (i.e., 1.3%) and thermal satisfaction levels above 98%. This result demonstrates the potential for deploying such systems in future real-world implementations, enabling personalised comfort and energy-efficient building operations."
