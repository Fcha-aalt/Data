## Abstract
"Energy conservation and indoor environment concerns have motivated extensive research on various aspects of control of Heating, Ventilating and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) and building systems. The study on optimal operation as well as modeling of HVAC and building systems is one of the fastest growing fields that contribute to saving energy and improving indoor environment of buildings. The reasonable operation adjustment is one of the main methods to improve the energy efficiency. Cooling load prediction is the foundation of the optimization operation. This paper is devoted to the development of a comprehensive modeling of cooling load for a large building with ice-storage systems in Beijing, China. The models describe the dynamics of cooling load, outdoor climate parameters and indoor parameters as one multi-variable nonlinear system in a way that is useful for prediction analysis. The cooling load data collected is from June to September, and then the method of similarity for both longitudinal and transverse waveforms is used to judge whether there is abnormal data. The optimal parameter setting in the proposed model is studied. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) method was applied to select input parameters. A load prediction model has been constructed based on BP neural networks. Taking account of the generalization ability of neural networks, this paper has chosen the bayesian regularization algorithm, which can get better fitting effect than other training algorithms, to train the neural networks. Then, the BP neural network model is used for the summer hourly cooling load prediction of the business building. Evaluation of the prediction accuracy of the proposed models is based on the root mean square error (RMSE). The results show that the prediction model can accurately predict the future hourly load of 1 week and 1 day, with the prediction error at 1.60% and 1.18% respectively. The analysis shows that this model is suitable for the practical engineering application and can provide a basis for optimal operation of air conditioning control systems of large public buildings."
