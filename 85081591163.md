## Abstract
"The proceedings contain 27 papers. The special focus in this conference is on Security of Industrial Control Systems and Cyber-Physical Systems. The topics include: ADIoT 2019 preface; anomaly detection for industrial control systems using sequence-to-sequence neural networks; a conceptual redesign of a modelling language for cyber resiliency of healthcare systems; shaping digital identities in social networks: Data elements and the role of privacy concerns; GDPR compliance: Proposed technical and organizational measures for cloud providers; on the applicability of security and privacy threat modeling for blockchain applications; privacy, security, legal and technology acceptance requirements for a gdpr compliance platform; uncertainty-aware authentication model for IoT; From ISO/IEC 27002:2013 information security controls to personal data protection controls: Guidelines for GDPR compliance; on the trade-off between privacy and utility in mobile services: A qualitative study; analysis of automation potentials in privacy impact assessment processes; an insight into decisive factors in cloud provider selection with a focus on security; reflective attenuation of cyber-physical attacks; discrete event simulation of jail operations in pursuit of organizational culture change; a basic theory of lightweight hierarchical key predistribution scheme; adversarial examples for hardware-trojan detection at gate-level netlists; selective forwarding attack on IoT home security kits; Denial-of-service attacks and countermeasures in the RPL-based internet of things; Study of DNS rebinding attacks on smart home devices; Anomaly detection in the HVAC system operation by a radviz based visualization-driven approach; secure location verification: Why you want your verifiers to be mobile; Distributed UCON in CoAP and MQTT protocols."
