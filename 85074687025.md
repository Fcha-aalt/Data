## Abstract
"Net zero energy buildings (NZEB) represent reality of new constructions in Europe for environmentally sustainable energy efficiency. The shift to net zero energy settlements represents a further opportunity to achieve extra-energy saving, thanks to utilities sharing, renewables optimization, and microclimate mitigation. This last aspect concerns the opportunity to improve settlements outdoor microclimate conditions in both hot and cold seasons, in a variety of climate conditions, with the purpose to improve occupants' wellbeing. At the same time, microclimate mitigation at inter-building scale may also involve relatively less severe boundary conditions able to reduce both cooling and heating demand of buildings and better working conditions for HVAC systems, e.g. heat pumps and air-to-air heat exchangers. This extra-energy saving, achievable with no extra costs, may represent an interesting opportunity to be taken into account in net zero energy settlements design and construction. This study analyzes this energy saving in a net zero energy settlement in Italy, built thanks to an on-going Horizon 2020 project. The influence of microclimate mitigation strategies is assessed in terms of energy saving benefits for the heat pump working conditions. Results demonstrate that this further benefit represents a non-negligible, environmentally sustainable, strategy for energy efficiency of NZEB in new inter-building scale developments."
