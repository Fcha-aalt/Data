## Abstract
"Smart homes are structural parts of the smart grid, since they contain controllable devices and energy management systems. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method for the energy scheduling of a smart home&#x0027;s energy storage system, heating ventilation and air conditioning system, and electric vehicle (EV). The proposed method targets to jointly minimize three evaluation metrics; the smart home&#x0027;s electricity cost, the residents&#x0027; thermal discomfort, and the EV user&#x0027;s range anxiety. An advanced reinforcement learning algorithm, the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3), is utilized for this purpose together with a process, which is based on data clustering, that augments the similarity degree between the train and the test sets. As a result, the considered evaluation metrics show a significant improvement. The smart homes electricity cost, for instance, can be reduced by up to 11.2&#x0025;, when compared with other RL-based works in the existing literature."
