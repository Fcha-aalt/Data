## Abstract
"• The grow room climate must be controlled to achieve effective yields • Temperature & Humidity (Vapor Pressure Deficit) • Lighting can be reduced too far. Complicated balance. • HVAC energy optimization • Careful selection of temperature, RH, and VPD is critical to reduce capital & operating costs • Metrics must be scaled to achieve maximum yield • System to control both the sensible and latent components will be the most energy efficient • Grower can achieve maximum product yield and a significant energy reduction with an appropriately designed and balanced system."
