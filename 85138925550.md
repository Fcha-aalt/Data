## Abstract
"This paper describes a framework for predictive maintenance in Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning installations in hotels using a Cyber-Physical System. Predictive maintenance implies high costs for the hotel sector, so that a low-cost energy-efficient design is essential. The proposed framework is based in the general framework proposed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and is inspired in the three-layer IoT architecture. This fact also provides the system with interoperability and flexibility. Finally, an application of the framework in a real installation - a five-star hotel - is also presented."
