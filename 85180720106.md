## Abstract
"This research seeks to improve the temperature control of AHU in building sub-levels using optimization algorithms. Specifically, the study applies the FA and PSO algorithms to optimize the PID control of AHU’s temperature. The study addresses the issue of temperature control in building sub-levels, which is a common challenge in HVAC systems. The study uses optimization algorithms and a nonlinear model to improve temperature control and reduce fluctuations in temperature from the desired setting. Additionally, a NL-ARX algorithm is utilized to create a nonlinear model based on the thermal dynamics and energy behavioral patterns of ACMV cooling systems. The study evaluates the performance of three controllers—PID, FA-PID, and PSO-PID—based on ITSE as a performance index. The study compares the performance of these controllers to achieve the desired temperature setting, and it analyses the influence of temperature regulation on occupant comfort levels. In this study, we compare different controllers using ITSE as a performance indicator. This shows how well different optimization algorithms work at setting the right temperature. The research gap is the lack of efficient temperature control solutions in building sub-levels that can optimize occupant comfort and energy efficiency. The experimental findings confirm that PSO-PID outperforms conventional PID and FA-PID optimization in terms of achieving the goal objective via computational complexity. Overall, this study’s focus is to explore and compare different optimization algorithms to improve temperature control and occupant comfort in building sub-levels."
