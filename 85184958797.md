## Abstract
"In this paper, an event-triggered adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm is developed for the temperature control of large-scale heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. First, the dynamic model of the system is established by using the conservation of mass and energy, which involves the dynamics of the fan and the cooling coil. Second, the multi-zone temperature control problem is treated as a non-zero-sum game, which requires solving the coupled Hamilton-Jacobian (HJ) equations. Then, the ADP algorithm is employed to solve the HJ equation. Importantly, in order to reduce the network transmission burden of large-scale HVAC systems, the ADP algorithm developed in this paper is based on event-triggering mechanism. Theoretical analysis proves that the tracking error and the neural network weight estimation error are uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the algorithm."
