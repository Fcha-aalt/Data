## Abstract
"This paper has two contributions: (1) it describes the design and implementation of a thermal network based building zone emulator environment suitable for control applications with inputs and outputs matching those of the OpenAI Gym environments; and (2) the use of the environment to train a proximal policy optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning (RL) agent to maintain comfort for a house while minimizing the HVAC system energy consumption. The building controls environment can be extended to many other cases including training agents that can be mass-applied, studying the behaviour of communities and studying occupant behaviour and comfort. The trained RL agent was compared to conventional bang-bang and proportional-integral controllers. Given the penalty weights, the RL agent was more adept at minimizing equipment cycling thus improving equipment longevity and efficiency."
