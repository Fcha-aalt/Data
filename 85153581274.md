## Abstract
"Systems associated with the Internet of Things (IoT) must have long battery life, a large coverage area, and low implementation costs. The architecture of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) solutions in commercial buildings was created using LoRa and evaluated to short-range wireless signals in an indoor setting. This study has compared things like battery life, coverage area, and storage capacity. The sensor node's battery usage was also tested with the LoRa transmission power. LoRa was shown to have a 60.4% greater indoor coverage range than short-range communication. Up to 198% of the energy usage may be saved by the intelligent controller's ability to determine while the area is vacant and the HVAC is turned off. Despite using 7.23% additional power, LoRa exhibited no container failures besides providing a global over58.98 percent more significant over the RFM 69HW detector, which is then compared with the RFM 69HW transceiver. LoRa is chosen for the implementation of smart controller in commercial buildings since it requires fewer base stations and hence has a lower cost because of the expanded exposure assortment inside structures."
