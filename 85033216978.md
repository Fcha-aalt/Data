## Abstract
"This study studied HVAC design scheme to build a cloud data center using the container type. In the data center, cooling systems compose of container unit and common equipment. To support high density IT service, the CRAC in container also has a more complex design using in-line cooling and redundancy equipment. And, described the center design to set up the common equipment to support scalability and just in time extension. The results can be used to design the CDC, requiring the scalability and the efficiency in operation."
