## Abstract
"In order to prevent any further increase on the global warming threshold, the HVAC market is still focused on improving energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gases. Therefore the market is still keen on adopting low-GWP air conditioning products. R32 refrigerant is considered as a mild-flammable refrigerant and when applied to a VRF system, it often requires additional safety measures such as shut-off valves, alarm and ventilation thereby causing more strain on the design and installation aspect of a R32 VRF system. Water based air conditioning system 'Hybrid VRF' was developed to mitigate this issue as it can still be designed, installed & commissioned as a VRF system, however reduces the requirement for any additional safety measures when R32 refrigerant is used."
