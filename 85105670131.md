## Abstract
"Nanofiber filters, with high particle removal efficiency and relatively low air resistance, can be used to reduce the fan energy consumption in the filtration units of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. This study first systematically compared the air resistance of nanofiber filters with the conventional HVAC filters. The linear regression between pressure drop and face velocity showed that 89% of the nanofiber filters collected from the literature had an R2 value greater than 0.9. The comparison of the air resistance coefficients (the pressure drop over the face velocity) demonstrated that nanofiber filters had considerably lower air resistance than conventional HVAC filters with similar particle removal efficiency. This study also reported the potential application of nanofiber film coated on window screens for reducing the entry of outdoor particles when opening the windows."
