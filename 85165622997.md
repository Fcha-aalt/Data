## Abstract
"Building energy modeling (BEM) has become increasingly used in building energy conservation research. Prototype building models are developed to represent the typical urban building characteristics of a specific building type, meteorological conditions, and construction year. This study included four residential buildings and 11 commercial buildings to represent nationwide building types in China. With consideration of five climate zones and different construction years corresponding to national standards, a total of 151 prototype building models were developed. The building envelope properties, occupancy and energy-related behaviors, and heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system characteristics were defined according to the corresponding building energy efficiency design standards, HVAC design standards, and through other sources, such as questionnaire surveys, on-site measurements, and literature, which reflect the real situation of existing buildings in China. Based on the developed prototype buildings, a large database of 9225 models in 270 cities was further developed to facilitate users to simulate building energy in different cities. In conclusion, the developed prototype building models can represent realistic building characteristics and construction practices of the most common residential and commercial buildings in China, serving as an important foundation for BEM. The models can be used for analyses related to building energy conservation research on typical individual buildings, including energy-saving technologies, advanced controls, and new policies, and providing a reference for the development of building energy codes and standards."
