## Abstract
"In this paper, we use publicly available data of a highly instrumented office building to estimate how zonal temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration are related to some key operational and environmental measurements. Subsequently, we have developed, simulated, and evaluated an optimization framework for minimizing the energy consumption of the central heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) unit while meeting zonal temperature and indoor air quality (IAQ) standards. Finally, we have evaluated the achievable energy savings for our proposed approach as compared to a baseline approach and reported significant savings potential."
