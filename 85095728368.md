## Abstract
"Product development in the HVAC business segment are continually showing disturbingly slow annual increases in product performance, gradually reducing profitability in the market. Cooling and heating technologies applied in the HVAC industry range from simple natural cooling to more advanced active solutions based on conventional compression technology, but the performance increase is fundamentally incremental. This paper presents the NeGeV project which will provide an innovative solution demonstrating a leap in ventilation systems performance through the use of phase change materials for active heat recovery during periods of cooling needs. The project will develop, design and produce a prototype system and document its performance through certified tests. Through development of intelligent controls for the system, the project will demonstrate the potential for system integration into a smart grid application of load shifting and optimal operation control. In addition, the technical and economic feasibility of the prototype will be evaluated considering an office-space case study."
