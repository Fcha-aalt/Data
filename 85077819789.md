## Abstract
"Energy consumption in Egypt's buildings has increased considerably with the growing need to achieve thermal comfort conditions inside buildings. The continuing increases in both residential and commercial buildings require an increase in power generation meeting the new demand. Energy consumption in buildings increases yearly due to the increase in HVAC systems operating hours. It is desirable to minimize the energy consumption and to promote the use of renewable energy resources, saving the earth from global warming effects and the depletion of the ozone layer. In hot and humid climatic regions, high temperatures with high humidity levels results in humans' discomfort leading to high HVAC energy consumption. In order to understand the energy performance in Egyptian hospitals as they have special requirements and massive energy consumption of HVAC equipment, medical equipment, lighting and infection control systems a hospital located in Alexandria, Egypt was chosen as a case study. The study aims to investigate the energy consumption in Egyptian hospitals and to evaluate the energy-saving efficiency of an existing building. A model for under construction hospital was created using DesignBuilder simulation tool. The initial model was validated based on the hospital construction and mechanical consultants' data. The initial model was then retrofitted firstly to the latest outdoor design conditions and weather file data recommended by ASHRAE and NREL. Energy efficient techniques affecting annual HVAC energy consumption and whole building energy were investigated. The study provides information for energy efficiency improvements in Alexandria, Egypt hospitals helping designers managing energy in buildings reducing the energy consumption sufficiently. A new DOAS was implemented for temperature and humidity independent control of HVAC system showing significant energy saving in both HVAC and whole building energy consumption. This research recommends a new energy models for future hospitals in Alexandria, Egypt improving the energy efficiency in Egyptian buildings."
