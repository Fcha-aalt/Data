## Abstract
"Every year, more than 20% of the energy consumption in the United States and more than 10% of the global consumption is used towards HVAC (Heating, Ventilating, Air-Conditioning) systems in buildings. Although continued efforts in advancing renewable energy, efficient appliances, and smart building systems are desired, the most critical factors that cause extensive indoor energy consumption are thermal leakage and thermal waste generation. We demonstrate a smart window film that allows natural lighting with a clear view while blocking oblique incident sunlight to make the building interior cooler without using electricity or generating heat. Building upon the concept of, often overlooked, traditional window shades and privacy window films, we emphasize and elevate the application and impact of using magnetically arranged nanoscale material for energy conservation purpose in buildings. By embedding vertically aligned Ni flakes (VANF) in a polymer matrix film, nanoscale mirror array serve as shades to block the high-angled incident sunlight, blocking approximately 73% of total solar irradiance and bringing down the indoor temperature by 1.92 Â°C during the daytime in a model house while providing nearly 90% transparency. Global application was simulated by applying the respective solar angle and intensity at selected latitudes, indicating their potential. This passively energy-conserving smart film is a low cost, maintenance free, and simple product for users and easy-to-manufacture product for the industry."
