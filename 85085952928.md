## Abstract
"The urgent need to decrease carbon emissions and the awareness of climate change leads to pay attention to energy demand in buildings. There is also an increasing concern with the perceived thermal comfort level of building's occupant. Therefore, suitable strategies are desirable to take advantage of the existing potential for energy savings in the indoor climate of a building, focusing on an improvement of the standard operating conditions of the heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems and looking for alternative criteria. Nevertheless a limited number of studies have taken place in Spain, and although there are outstanding researches within this field of study, continuing exploring the process of thermal comfort and the human being adaptation is always desirable. Consequently, a field study has been carried out in the southwest of Spain for several months in an educational building, involving monitoring environmental parameters and surveys."
