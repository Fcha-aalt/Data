## Abstract
"Today, HVAC systems are responsible for 15 to 60% of the total energy consumption of a building, depending on its intended use. Effective and efficient utilization of energy and the reduction of energy losses are of particular importance in this regard. In recent years, studies examining the HVAC system parameters for reducing energy consumption have revealed the need for higher performance regarding the temperature, capacity and control strategies in the resulting systems. In this study, a system was developed with IP-based smart sensors for improving the energy efficiency of the HVAC systems used in a building by determining the characteristics of the building and measuring its thermal losses. With this system, the detection of heat loss besides that of user-induced faults, as well as the reduction of these losses can be achieved. It is to this aim that the designed IP electronic system provides for access to offices via the Internet, while output data are provided through the features operating to reduce energy loss."
