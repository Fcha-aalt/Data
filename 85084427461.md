## Abstract
"The energy management of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system is a primary concern in building projects. Although they allow us to identify opportunities for effective energy use, their‚Å† cost can sometimes exceed the energy saved. On the contrary, controller tuning by e.g. set-point regulation, often provides solutions that incur relatively low or no extra cost. In this paper, a simulation-based optimization approach is proposed for the optimal set-point regulation of HVAC system. For this purpose, we developed dynamic models for the target HVAC system that can simulate system behaviour at intervals of one minute. The set-point values were optimized while assessing controllability. The optimization of set-points that considered only energy efficiency led to various faults and therefore, was not applicable. However, optimal set-points obtained by considering controllability can help avoid significant faults."
