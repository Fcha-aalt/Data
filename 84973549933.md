## Abstract
"This presentation is a step by step explanation and analysis of how Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVAC and R) equipment is affected by corrosion in heat exchanger coils. We look at how this impacts on efficiency and how it can be prevented in new units or stopped in existing units. The Return on Investment (ROI) of corrosion prevention and the options available in the current market place is also discussed."
