## Abstract
"Model predictive control (MPC), although considered a high-potential control approach, usually requires considerable effort for model-creation and parametrization. Moreover, many previous studies use linear models that over-simplify the complex phenomena in building energy systems (BES). By contrast, simulation models can be too computationally intensive for control applications. Distributed model predictive control (DMPC) is a promising approach that avoids the construction of a complex model of the total system and thus facilitates modelling and supports the use of exact simulation models. DMPC divides the optimization problem into sub-problems, with the advantage that pre-fabricated simulation models from standard libraries and models provided by component manufacturers can be used. Moreover, each optimization problem, considered for its own, becomes smaller and, in whole, can be solved faster compared to an integrated system model. The distributed optimizations must be coordinated to achieve near-global-optimum performance. This coordination requires a suitable scheme, which, in many publications, is based on iterative data exchange between the subsystems. In previous works, the authors developed a non-iterative algorithm based on the exchange of lookup tables. In this paper, they compare and benchmark the previously developed approach against a second iterative approach to show advantages and limitations of both algorithms. To perform a comparative case study, the authors implement the two approaches in a flexible object-oriented framework that allows selection of various optimization cost functions such as exergetic and monetary costs. The authors apply both approaches to a real-life air-handling unit and its Modelica simulation model while using Modelica models and non-linear solvers for the DMPC algorithms. They make simplifying assumptions to provide mathematical justification regarding the optimality of the approach. Judging from the indicators for control quality and the monetary operation costs in the case study, the authors draw conclusions regarding the most suitable DMPC approach for generic building energy systems."
