## Abstract
"Ideally, building devices should be installed in a set-and-forget manner with minimum device configuration. In practice however, the correct interaction between all devices must be assured in order for the building to function properly, e.g., each motion detector has to be associated to the correct ceiling lamps. Currently, the initial commissioning of the devices in a building is a manual task, labour intensive and prone to errors. In this work, we show how to use state of the art building management systems (BMS) and modern device design in order to minimize building commissioning time. We summarize device data mining techniques which extract device groups, the building hierarchical structure, and the relative position of spatial sensors; we explore their applicability to the building's commissioning and maintenance stages. Finally, we propose a technique to auto-commission the lighting and HVAC systems of buildings."
