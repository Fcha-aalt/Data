## Abstract
"This paper describes the design of photovoltaic system and heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) system of the Resilient Nest team from King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT) which had been operated in Solar Decathlon Europe 2019 (SDE19) energyefficient home building competition. The competition has 10 contests and their corresponding sub-contests which involve holistic building science and architecture. The Resilient Nest shows the result of Positive Electrical Balance sub-contest which leads to Net Zero Energy Building (NZEB) scheme that this competition challenges the competing teams to use their innovative strategies to achieve the status and Comfort Conditions contest to showcase the performance of the team's HVAC system."
