## Abstract
"Threshold moisture conditions required to initiate humidity-related mold growth are poorly understood, and there is no accepted level of humidity control for preventing mold growth. Humidity-related mold growth can be a major problem in unoccupied school area over the summer. Continuous data-logging of temperature, dew point and relative humidity with engineering evaluation of HVAC systems allowed for a comparison of conditions in schools with and without mold growth. Mold growth appeared to be associated with the percentage of elevated relative humidity (RH) days, rather than average or peak RH. Mold growth was only observed in schools where HVAC systems had major equipment and operational deficiencies. A comparison of air-conditioning schedules suggested that a brief period of daily air-conditioning was generally sufficient to prevent mold growth. Restricting cooling system operation to a few hours per day is suggested as an energy-efficient strategy to prevent mold growth in unoccupied schools."
