## Abstract
"Organic phase change materials (PCMs) have been mixed with suitable building materials and the resulting form stable-composite PCMs (FS-CPCMs) have been used for low temperature-thermal energy storage (TES) applications for passive solar heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) purposes in building envelopes. Here, three novel types of FS-CPCMs were prepared as TES materials for building applications by absorption of capric (CA)-palmitic acid (PA) eutectic mixture, heptadecane (HEPD) and dodecanol (DD) as different kinds of organic PCMs into pumice (PUM) via vacuum impregnation. The maximum mass percentages of CA-PA, HEPD and DD into FS-CPCMs were determined as 34 wt%, 32 wt%, and 31 wt%, respectively. The chemical, morphological and thermal characterizations of the developed FS-CPCMs were performed by SEM, FT-IR, DSC, and TG analysis techniques. SEM and FT-IR results showed that the selected organic PCMs were well incorporated into the pores of the PUM particles and have good compatibility among the components of the composites. DSC analysis indicated that the phase change temperatures and TES capacities of the fabricated FS-CPCMs were in the range of 20.98-23.27 °C and 55.40-72.38 J/g, respectively. TG analysis results revealed that the prepared FS-CPCMs are thermally stable. The thermal cycling test also showed that they have excellent structural stability and good stability for TES characteristics after 3000 cycles. The FS-CPCMs were tested in the form of plasters firstly in this study, which is similar to large-scale building applications. Thermal performance tests showed that the gypsum plasters with the FS-CPCMs can be improved the thermal comfort keeping the indoor temperature at the comfortable range for a long time and reduced the energy consumption. Based on all results, it can be deduced that the newly developed PUM/CA-PA, PUM/HEPD and PUM/DD are potential FS-CPCMs for low temperature-HVAC applications in the construction of energy-efficient buildings."
