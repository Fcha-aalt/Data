## Abstract
"In the era of post-Coronavirus Disease 2019, the dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS), which provides 100% outdoor air for the building, is widely acknowledged as it can ensure acceptable indoor air quality by delivering fresh outdoor air to occupied space. The DOAS with a proper design and operation can provide sufficient ventilation and dehumidification while achieving energy efficiency. Nonetheless, there is limited guidance in determining the optimal control sequence of the DOAS for the designers and operators to implement in practice. Accordingly, in practice, a number of issues have been acknowledged in the design and control phases of DOAS, including insufficient ventilation and dehumidification, and increasing supply air dry-bulb temperature in fear of over-cooling, which might cause significant discomfort and energy waste. There have been efforts to develop high-performing DOAS controls for better energy efficiency. However, such controls are often complex, or difficult to interpret, for building designers and operators to consider in practice. In this regard, this paper explores a simulation-based framework for generating a supply air temperature control sequence of the DOAS not only to ensure improved energy-saving potential but also to guarantee the implement-ability of the control logic. The U.S. Department of Energy prototype primary school with dynamic occupancy profiles was modeled with a whole building simulation program, EnergyPlus. The model consists of a DOAS with an exhaust air energy recovery system for ventilation and fan-coil units for space cooling and heating. Then, a Genetic Algorithm was adopted to find the true optimal supply air temperature control sequence in terms of minimizing the energy cost of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system operation. Lastly, Decision Tree was adopted to extract rules out of the optimums to derive an implementable sequence of operation for the DOAS supply air temperature. A total of 12 week-simulation including four weeks of heating, cooling, and shoulder seasons, separately, under the weather condition of New York City was conducted for the case study. This case study identified that the optimization-informed rule extraction-based control, when compared to conventional outdoor air temperature-based reset control, could save about 13% of energy cost and 25% of energy consumption throughout the heating, cooling, and shoulder seasons. It is notable that the energy-saving was mainly achieved by reducing the heating energy consumption. Importantly, it nearly corresponds to the true optimal control result, which reduces approximately 14% of energy cost and 27% of energy consumption. From the results, it can be highlighted that the optimization-informed rule extraction can be as energy effective as the optimal control, while significantly reducing the complexity of the control."
